<p class=H2 align=center style='text-align:center'>Langford - Hickman Township</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Langford is situated on a gentle rise of ground commanding a
good view of the surrounding country, and is located on section 29 and 32. J.N.
Lindley, from Fox Lake, Wis., located on NW1/4 Section, 32 in 1883, and last
June gave the railroad company a divided half of his claim to locate the town
site there. Geo. Cole, from Minnesota, settled on SW1/4 Sec. 29 in 1883, and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>sold his claim to the railroad company. Sam Denton surveyed
Langford and a plat of 190 acres completed July 1, 1886, on the same day that
the railroad track reached there. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Up to the present date, July 10, quite a number of buildings
are rapidly approaching completion. Jno. A. Edmands, of Andover, had a large
shanty hauled here June 20, and put in a stock of hardware; is the first
business place established in Langford. Daniel W. Farquhar, the blacksmith,
came here from Groton and put up his shop the next day after Edmands's shanty
arrived. Mr. Farquhar is one of the old veterans of the rebellion. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The railroad-company built a section house and had it
shingled July 8. The Depot is well underway and will be completed in a short
time. Hamiltion and Shepard from Winona, Minn., under the firm name of Dakota
Lumber Co., have their large lumber office nearly completed. W.N. Daniels, from
Groton, erected a temporary hotel. J.N. Lindley, real estate and insurance
agent, has his office completed. Mr. Lindley dug the first well in town, near
the depot; it is 23 feet deep, with an abundance of good water. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A. Folsom, from New Hampshire, came to the Sisseton Agency
in 1876, where he clerked several years, and can talk &quot;Injun&quot; like a
Sioux. Later clerked in Webster and Andover. May 1, 1886 put in a stock of
groceries in the Babcock-Brown store at Haupt. Mr. Folsom built a large store,
and has the first general merchandise store in the village. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>G.G Grenn and P.O. Melland, from Groton, have about
completed their pioneer restaurant. Labord and Langhorn put up a shanty at
Haupt last June and opened a Saloon; on the 7th inst. moved to Langford. McCord
and Newland will shortly erect a paint and sign writing shop. Several elevators
and business places will be completed after harvest. Langford possesses every
advantage to become a first-class railroad town. </p>

<p class=H2 align=center style='text-align:center'>Hickman - 125-58</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>About one-third of this township lies on the plateau, which,
with the exception of several coulees in the level and good farming land; the
other two-thirds lie in the valley; the surface rather level. There are several
ravines or coulees that emerge from the Couteaus in Sisseton Township and run
in a westerly direction; one of these coulees crosses sections 12, 11, 10, 9
and 8, and on sec 7 spreads out like a fan, covering three quarter section of
land, making an excellent meadow. This coulee on sec. 11 contained some timber,
currants, gooseberries and raspberries, also plum trees. Excellent drinking
water is easily obtained anywhere along this coulee. </p>

<p class=H2 align=center style='text-align:center'>Pioneer Settlers</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ferdinand Gamache, born near Quebec, Canada, came here from
Dayton, Minn. Oct. 1, 1882; not being able to secure a team in Andover to haul
a load of lumber, he went to Groton, where he hired a man and team. They
reached here after a days journey and Mr. Gamache erected his shanty on sec. 33
about the time the township was surveyed and soon after returned to Minnesota,
and came back the next spring. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Henry Gerberich, from Niles, Mich., built a shanty where he
now lives, sec. 31 Oct. 12, '82; his brother, Joseph, located on sec. 30 the
next spring. Henry Gerberich was elected county commissioner in 1885; is also
school and township clerk. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

popularly known as Bill X. They are natives of Wales and came here from Bath,
Brown County, and located on the south half of sec. 20. They erected their
shanties the next day after Gerberich built his, and broke a few furrows for
firebreaks and while here that fall, boarded at Mr. Sheldon's, ten miles
distant. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the fall of '82 Geo. Hickman helped A.T. Hammond, near
Mr. Gaub, move to his claim from Bath. The next day Nov. 11, he, Bill X, and
Henry Gerberich, went to the Fort where they were snow-bound for several days,
the winter having set in much earlier than usual. George Hickman was much
pleased with this part of the country, and the next winter he hauled a load of
lumber from Bath, which is forty miles from here, and built a shack on the
southwest corner of sec. 8, but in March, when the land came in market, he
filed on the southeast quarter where he lives. He was born near Heidelburg,
Germany, and came here from Bath, having moved from Sac County, Ia., was
elected county Superintendent of schools of Day County in 1884. </p>
