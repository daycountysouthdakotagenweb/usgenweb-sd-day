I am searching for information on my great-granfather Nicholas ENGLER, and his wife--Mary LUND.  She would have died in 1919, soon after my grandfather was born.  We know very little about Nicholas and Mary because my grandfather was sent to live with his uncle when his mother died.  Nicholas's father was Jacob ENGLER, born in Pennsylvania.  Any information on the ENGLERS would be greatly appreciated. <br></td></tr></table>

    I am looking for my Greatgrandparents: Mary Priscilla (Lamoreaux) Thompson

    (correct), her mother born in England and Her father born in Canada - these 
    are correct as well. Mary Priscilla's birthdate is only 2 years off. I 
    wondered if there are any records of her and if there may be marriage 
    records of her and my Greatgrandfather Harvey Thompson. I'm not sure how 
    much after 1880 they may have been in the County as I have &quot;unconfirmed&quot;

    I am looking for any information on Andrew and MaryAnn Barnett and family. 
    Andrew was born in MD in 1832 and died in Day County in 1911. MaryAnn was 
    born in Virginia in 1842 and died in Webster, SD in 1924. Andrew was 
    MaryAnn's 3rd husband. I have found them listed in Highland Township in the 
    1900 &amp; 1910 census - and MaryAnn in Webster in 1920. A son, James Walton, 
    from her first marriage also shows up in the same censuses as MaryAnn. Two 
    daughters are also in the SD censuses - America (Mary) Blocker and Ematel 
    (Emma) Blocker. America is in the 1900, 1920 &amp; 1930 censuses in Webster. I 
    believe she might have been married to Lloyd Blocker. His name appears in a 
    Day County index, and Mrs. L. Blocker appears in a later index. Emma was 
    married to John Blocker. Her name appears in the index for Day County and 
    was also in the 1900, 1920 &amp; 1930 censuses in Highland Twp/Webster. (I 
    couldn't find either America or Emma in 1910). America ran a boardinghouse 
    at one time in Webster according to the census. I would appreciate if 
    someone could check cemeteries, obituaries, church records, etc. from the 
    area for any of these people. America and Ematel are sisters to my husband's 
    g grandfather, Martin Coleman Barber. I would really love to hear from any 
    relatives who may be looking for information on this family. Martin's father 
    was also Martin Coleman Barber and this part of the family settled in 
    Fillmore County, Minnesota. <br>

        or 1870. He married a Mary Tschakert. They had a son Harry Arthur 
        French. Some of Harry's cousins in the area were the Whites and

        I am looking for any information on Ole Milbeck and Kerstin Anderson. 
        They had five children: Amelia b 1-11-1887, Olga Melvina b 10-24-1888, 
        Linda Carolina b 12-20-1890, Albert Oliver b 8-14-1897, and Minnie 
        Rebecca b 5-17-1901. I know that Ole had land in 1909, and that he is in 
        the &quot;History of Day County&quot; on pages 182-186. I don't have any 
        information after 1926. Any information would help alot. I did hear 
        somewhere that my great grandmother's parents came from Norway. Amelia 
        is my great grandmother. She married John o. Carlson in bristol on 
        1-27-1909. I also was told that Ole and Kerstin owned a machine that cut 
        hay and wheat and that they went to neighboring farms to do this. That 
        was how my great grandparents met. He was a laborer and she took care of 
        the food wagon. I hope someone out there can help me. thanks <br>

    <p>I am searching for my family members who settled in the Webster, SD area 
    around 1880's. The surnames I am researching are: TOMASZEWSKI, REBELSKI, 
    DOLNEY, FINSKI..., but not limited to. From talking to some long lost 
    relatives and searching through records - here's what I've put together. 
    Mary Tomaszewski (d: 1904/05) came from Germany (1875-1879 ish). In the 1880 
    New Posen, Swift Co., Minnesota census she is living with he daughter Rose 
    (John and their children) Handke and her son Michael Tomaszewski. And in the 
    1885 census she and Michael are gone, but Rose and her family are still 
    there. Until recently I assumed she died since Mary was 60ish in the 1880 
    census, but I found an old copy of her will - which lead me to Grenville, 
    SD. I know her son Michael Tomaszewski married Katherine Piotrowski around 
    1883 in New Posen, MN and they had a son (my great grandfather) Thomas 
    Tomaszewski in July of 1884 in New Posen (Appleton, MN) - but again 
    disappeared after this. I believe Michael died shortly after Thomas was 
    born, because Katherine Tomaszewski did remarry and had more children with 
    Mr. Macheck (spelling). I wrote to the Day count courthouse and was able to 
    get all the papers included in the will and they were very helpful, but do 
    not answer all my questions.</p>

    <p>We have been searching for my wifes mother's biological father, Fred 
    Williams for quite a few years.&nbsp; A new clue surfaced that he may have 
    been from the Waubay area.&nbsp; We believe he was born in 1897.&nbsp; He 
    worked in Sioux Falls at waterworks at age 35 in 1933.&nbsp; He lived at 917 
    S. Grange Ave. Sioux Falls at that time.&nbsp; His birthplace was listed at 
    Strausberg. He was 5-8, dark hair, blue eyes, ruddy complexion.&nbsp; High 
    School education.&nbsp; Married, divorced, with two children.....a boy and a 
    girl, before he met Opal Wilkens (wifes mother's biological mother).&nbsp; 
    They had a girl (who was placed with the Children's Home Society in Sioux 
    Falls) and later adopted by Mr. and Mrs. James Cameron of Wilmot.&nbsp; We 
    were wondering if you had anything in the Day County history which might 
    point us in the right direction.&nbsp; Thanks in advance for any clues you 
    may send us.</p>

    My great grandparents were Carl/Kleber/Kluber and Christina Carstensen/Karstensen. 
    They are listed on the 1900 Day county census, Central Point. They lived 
    with two children and Christina's parents, Casen and Christiana Carstensen. 
    I am trying to find any information on this family. They moved to Ok. in 
    1908 without Christina's parents. Had they passed away by then? Who were 
    Carl Kleber/Kluber's parents. He was born in 1873 in Cross Plaines, Wi. and 
    moved to S.D. as an infant. He was baptized as an infant in the Evangelical 
    Lutheran Canistota, S.D. I would appreciate any help with these families. 
    Please e-mail LHamr58558@aol.com Thanks so much! Lisa </p>
