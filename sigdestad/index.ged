1 NOTE Thoughts of John S. Sigdestad, by his son Daniel
2 CONT
2 CONT           Father's only day of rest was on Sunday.  His all-occasion
2 CONC blue serge suit served him so long that the seat of his pants shone
2 CONC like a mirror.  He was "klokker" (sexton) for many years in Bergen
2 CONC church until the English language replaced the old Norwegian about the
2 CONC year 1917.  The folks saw to it that we were faithful in our church
2 CONC attendance. Only unfeigned illness or inclement weather kept us at
2 CONC home.
2 CONT           Dad was a typical immigrant from Norway.  His life was a
2 CONC difficult way of life.  The
2 CONT mountainous terrain where he had lived afforded no space for grain
2 CONC pursuits.  Many were
2 CONT discouraged at the dim prospects of owning a farm, due to the
2 CONC traditional custom of inheritance.  He became restless. Anxious for a
2 CONC life in America and a strong desire for a better life caused him,
2 CONC together with countless others, to leave their fatherland, braving the
2 CONC unknown seas for a venture in an unknown land.  Dad braced for the
2 CONC expected and unexpected evils of the unforgiving ocean on its
2 CONC unescorted and lonely trip
2 CONT into chartered waters and unchartered dangers.
2 CONT           Tradition had it that the oldest son in the family should
2 CONC have a right to the farm; others had to search for work elsewhere.
2 CONC News from America may have been exaggerated at times, but the
2 CONC encouragement to emigrate was all that was needed to convince them
2 CONC that a journey to the new land was worthwhile.  So with a stubborn
2 CONC determination and a positive attitude they forged ahead.
2 CONT           Dad was a symbol of this type.  He landed with other members
2 CONC of his family in
2 CONT Montevideo, Minnesota, in July, 1881. He worked on farms for 25 cents
2 CONC a day and in winter months got his room and board for his work.  After
2 CONC four years in that area, the family traveled via covered wagon to Day
2 CONC County, South Dakota, landing in Lynn township in 1885. Here he filed
2 CONC on 80 acres of land and later purchased a quarter section from Ben
2 CONC Bakken on which he built his home. In 1891 he bought the rights to a
2 CONC tree-claim where he planted a grove of trees that has since decorated
2 CONC that land and which is mine today.
2 CONT      The pioneers rose with the sun and labored as it crossed the
2 CONC heavens, and when it sank behind the western horizon they cheerfully
2 CONC headed home--tired but happy in the consciousness of a day's work
2 CONC done.

2 CONT Marie kept house for her brother until such a time that Dad was able
2 CONC to woo her away from her

2 CONC about their courtship, but
2 CONT on July 2, 1891 they were married. Here they labored faithfully
2 CONC against many odds in the early
2 CONT days of farming.  Drought, grasshopper, hail and prairie fires raised

2 CONT efforts in trying to raise a crop, but their persistent courage was
2 CONC not intimidated by reverses.

2 CONT
2 CONT      The golden morning sun rose radiantly over the hills and valleys
2 CONC on the South Dakota
2 CONT prairie that beautiful autumn day when mother's anxious moment
2 CONC culminated in my arrival into
2 CONT this world.
2 CONT      Mother had previously lost a pair of twins which left her
2 CONC grief-stricken and sad.  With
2 CONT implicit faith in her Lord and an abiding trust in His promises, she
2 CONC prayed in her distress that God
2 CONT would entrust her with another pair of twins.  I am here as a result
2 CONC of her ardent and impassioned
2 CONT prayers.
2 CONT      Selmer and I were born at home on Sunday September 17, 1899.
2 CONC These births healed the
2 CONT fallen, yet indomitable spirit of mother whose trusting faith and
2 CONC fidelity could not be shaken or
2 CONT dimmed.  How fortunate to be born into a family whose lives were
2 CONC centered around and
2 CONT motivated by their loving Savior.
2 CONT      My earliest recollection of home was my inability to enter the
2 CONC shanty adjacent to the
2 CONT house under construction because I could not operate the latch-string
2 CONC on the door.
2 CONT           I well remember how mother took pains in dressing us, partly
2 CONC so as to confound the
2 CONT relatives in identifying us. For her own way of telling us apart she
2 CONC tied a red hankerchief around
2 CONT the neck of one of us.  Could it be that the one so designated would
2 CONC unfasten the tie, thereby
2 CONT confusing mother?  Not likely!  We were too young for such pranks,
2 CONC possibly only two or three
2 CONT years old.
2 CONT           Carefree summers soon came to an abrupt end when we were old
2 CONC enough to go to school.
2 CONT My first day in school will always linger in my mind.  Dad brought us
2 CONC to school in a buggy
2 CONT drawn by King and Prince.  As Dad left the school grounds I cried
2 CONC uncontrollably.  Not even the
2 CONT loving, assuring voice of a concerned teacher could control my
2 CONC lonesome, homesick feeling.
2 CONT Peering through the west window of the schoolroom I watched Dad
2 CONC returning to our clearly
2 CONT visible home until I lost sight of him as he turned off the road
2 CONC towards the barn. The first
2 CONT day of school seemed endless, but it came and went.  The distance home
2 CONC that first day was
2 CONT joyfully shortened by the thrill of going home where I felt more
2 CONC secure.  Our shortcut route to the
2 CONT schoolhouse was a clearly defined path across Anton Norby's and Uncle
2 CONC Sakris's fields rather
2 CONT than walking the main road.  Selmer would invariably take the lead.
2 CONC Over the stubble fields he
2 CONT would aim the course so straight that we marveled at his ability to do
2 CONC so at such an early age.
2 CONT This same course was repeated each year through-out our eight years of
2 CONC rural school training.
2 CONT This path was visible for a long distance until it was plowed under in
2 CONC late fall when a new and
2 CONT more difficult path had to be made over the plowed ground.
2 CONT      For boys growing up on the farm the most difficult part of
2 CONC starting school again after
2 CONT having gone bare-foot during summer may have been the wearing of shoes
2 CONC which the calloused
2 CONT and unfettered feet protested.
2 CONT           Clothing was drab for the most part for school children.
2 CONC Girls wore their hair in braids tied
2 CONT with large bows or worn with a band.  The boys' hair was usually
2 CONC trimmed with shears.  To get
2 CONT the edges somewhat even a large bowl was placed on the head so the
2 CONC shears followed the contour
2 CONT of the bowl.
2 CONT           My first grade teacher, Carrie Vale, was one who went beyond
2 CONC her call of duty.  Individual
2 CONT help was never denied any pupil in spite of a full daily schedule in
2 CONC an overcrowded one-room
2 CONT school.
2 CONT           When we grew older we helped our parents with their daily
2 CONC chores.  Even as preschoolers
2 CONT Selmer and I would offer to milk a certain tame cow although mother
2 CONC frowned on that offer
2 CONT because of the danger involved.  We were confident we could trust our
2 CONC pet cow, so with pail in
2 CONT one hand and stool in the other we sat down to prove our offer, Selmer
2 CONC on one side and I on the
2 CONT other.  We did it, but mother thought we worked too fast, so she
2 CONC tested our feeble attempt to see
2 CONT if we had gotten that last drop of milk.  We were taught at an early
2 CONC age that whatever was worth
2 CONT doing was worth doing well, so the next time we offered to help, we
2 CONC tried to perform to mother's
2 CONT liking.  A few years later, however, we could never figure out why we
2 CONC were so anxious to learn
2 CONT the art of milking.  When we didn't have to do it,  it was fun; but
2 CONC when that became our daily
2 CONT chore it was far less appealing.
2 CONT           Another chore after school was helping mother by going to
2 CONC the pasture to pick cow chips.
2 CONT We would take partially dried chips, stack them in pairs in an upright
2 CONC position for further drying.
2 CONT In a day or two, depending upon the need, we would take gunny sacks,
2 CONC gather the dried chips and
2 CONT carry the sacks home on our shoulders.
2 CONT           Water was heated in a pan or kettle atop a coal-burning
2 CONC stove.  The large oven turned out
2 CONT golden loaves of relished bread.  The inviting aroma in the kitchen on
2 CONC such days was impelling
2 CONT enough to make us want to help mother feed the stove, knowing we could
2 CONC sample the bread, hot
2 CONT from the oven.
2 CONT           We always had enough to eat, though I am sure it taxed
2 CONC Mother's ingenuity to plan meals
2 CONT on a small budget. Bread we had always, potatoes and other vegetables
2 CONC from the garden were
2 CONT abundant.  Beef and pork raised on the farm rounded out the meals with
2 CONC an occasional duck or
2 CONT jackrabbit. We learned at an early age not to waste food.  We were
2 CONC often chided if an uneaten
2 CONT portion of food was left on or behind the plate.  Often crusts of
2 CONC bread were left hidden behind the
2 CONT plate, unseen by the offender but clearly visible to the scrutinizing
2 CONC eyes of Mother and Dad.
2 CONT They made sure that it was eaten before we could have our dessert.
2 CONC The cookie jar was always a
2 CONT temptation.  We were never denied any food, but between meals we were
2 CONC taught to ask for it.
2 CONT      A wash stand and a cistern pump occupied a corner of the large
2 CONC kitchen.  Therewas also a
2 CONT pail for water and a dipper.  Jackets, caps and coats were hung on a
2 CONC row ofhooks behind the
2 CONT kitchen door.  Under the watchful eye of mother these hooks were
2 CONC usedas expected.  Clothes
2 CONT draped over a convenient chair or dropped on the floor or
2 CONC carelesslytossed in a corner were
2 CONT quickly identified with its proper owner.  Overshoes were lined
2 CONC upneatly near the door on a piece
2 CONT of paper to protect the floor.  Mud or snow was often trackedin
2 CONC nonetheless, and Mother did a lot
2 CONT of mopping up on her linoleum-covered floor.
2 CONT           On wash days a goodly part of the kitchen became a laundry
2 CONC room.  A wash tubplaced on a
2 CONT bench and a copper boiler were brought in from their storage place.
2 CONC Water washeated in the
2 CONT boiler on the kitchen range.  All clothes were rubbed and scrubbed by
2 CONC handon a washboard.
2 CONT Clothes were hung outside to dry.  In winter the clothes would freeze
2 CONC stiffon the line.  The
2 CONT long-handled underwear ranging down-ward in size from Dad's 40 to
2 CONC Joel's diminutive
2 CONT proportion assumed grotesque shapes.  Improper handling in this frozen
2 CONC condition could damage
2 CONT the fabric, so they were carried in carefully like headless ghosts.  A
2 CONC few minutes in the warm
2 CONT kitchen would collapse them enough so they could be draped over chairs
2 CONC to complete drying.  It
2 CONT was little wonder that Mother's hands remained red, swollen and sore.
2 CONC The rite of the Saturday
2 CONT night bath was likewise performed in the kitchen.  Again the water was
2 CONC heated in the kitchen.
2 CONT One at a time we stepped into the wash tub.  All wastewater was
2 CONC carried outside to be dumped.
2 CONT This was usually done by the one next in line unless Dad was close by.
2 CONT      After supper the table was cleared so we could use it as a desk
2 CONC on which to do our
2 CONT homework.  Many were the arithmetic problems with which I struggled!
2 CONT      A large hard-coal heater took up considerable space in the living
2 CONC room.  We never tired
2 CONT of admiring the distorted images of our faces reflected in the highly
2 CONC polished nickel-plated
2 CONT trimmings.  The smoothly rounded surfaces were wonderful against which
2 CONC to warm our cold
2 CONT hands and feet.  In wintertime we both dressed and undressed within
2 CONC the circle of that pleasant
2 CONT warmth.  The cheerful glow of fire within shone through the isinglass
2 CONC doors that, when viewed
2 CONT from the outdoors, caused us to rush through our chores so we could
2 CONC get back into the house to
2 CONT enjoy the comfort of that inviting glow.
2 CONT           A stairway off the kitchen led to the bedrooms upstairs.
2 CONC These rooms were suffocatingly
2 CONT hot in summer and frigid in winter.  A heavy patchwork quilt over
2 CONC woolen blankets covered each
2 CONT bed.  In extreme wintry weather layers of news-paper were placed
2 CONC between the blankets for added
2 CONT warmth. Bedbugs, often found in egg crates exchanged when eggs were
2 CONC hauled to town,
2 CONT abounded in spite of mother's unending war against them.  Men who
2 CONC often worked in logging
2 CONT camps in winter would bring with them these infectious creatures,
2 CONC thereby multiplying and
2 CONT augmenting the already heavy load of our distraught mother.  She would
2 CONC spray kerosene behind
2 CONT the moldings, into the cracks, over the frame and springs and even
2 CONC into the corners of the
2 CONT mattresses.
2 CONT      Mother's life with Dad was generally tranquil.  Dad worked hard
2 CONC to provide for us in so
2 CONT many ways.  Childhood diseases in the early 1900's added to the
2 CONC parent's worries. Most children
2 CONT caught and survived chicken pox, measles, mumps whooping cough and
2 CONC scarlet fever.  We
2 CONT always strove for perfect attendance in school, but when I was in
2 CONC fifth grade I contracted mumps
2 CONT which forced me to stay home for a week--there went my attendance
2 CONC record!  Clara was the only
2 CONT one of us that had a perfect record throughout her eight years of
2 CONC school for which she was
2 CONT recognized at graduation time.
2 CONT 	Travel during the early years was at best very crude and slow.  Roads
2 CONC were only trails and
2 CONT money for road building was scarce.  I can recall the time when a team
2 CONC of horses pulling a
2 CONT hand-controlled scraper was used to fill in low places, thus making a
2 CONC grade over watered areas.
2 CONT Culverts were made of wood to be placed in low areas, then covered
2 CONC with dirt for drainage
2 CONT purposes.  Of course oxen supplied the earliest power used for
2 CONC transportation.  They were often
2 CONT hitched with horses for added power.  Later horses replaced the oxen,
2 CONC speeding up the work.  The
2 CONT buggy replaced the wagon, thus reducing the time it took to go places.
2 CONC
2 CONT      Exchange work with the neighbors was common.  During winter
2 CONC months sleighs were
2 CONT used; also a light rig known as a cutter.  Before the automobile came
2 CONC into being we had a shiny
2 CONT new buggy with a collapsible top, equipped with side curtains for use
2 CONC in bad weather or as
2 CONT protection from the sun.  A new buggy and a frisky horse was the
2 CONC desire of those who could
2 CONT afford it and the envy of those less fortunate.
2 CONT      Our first automobile was a 1917 Reo with a collapsible top and
2 CONC side curtains.  It was a
2 CONT sturdy, rugged four-cylinder model that, when forced, could attain to
2 CONC a speed of 35 miles an hour.
2 CONT When it came to muddy roads it could plow its way through with little
2 CONC difficulty.  During the
2 CONT winter months the car was jacked  up to save the tires, and the
2 CONC battery placed in the cellar to keep
2 CONT it from freezing.
2 CONT      Life before the turn of the century was very simple. There was no
2 CONC electricity, no
2 CONT telephones and no running water. A clearly defined path led to the
2 CONC outhouses where the
2 CONT Montgomery Ward and Sears Roebuck catalogues served their final
2 CONC purpose.
2 CONT      Whatever we had was a result of what we ourselves created.  We
2 CONC made our sleds, and
2 CONT made skis from old discarded door tracks or staves from large barrels.
2 CONC Harnesses made from
2 CONT twine were used when we hitched trained calves to pull us around in
2 CONC our little wagon.
2 CONT      To get water for the livestock a well had to be dug by hand.
2 CONC That required an enormous
2 CONT amount of work.  Usually the well was dug with a tiling spade.  The
2 CONC dirt was hoisted up in
2 CONT buckets which, when moist, would be difficult to empty.  Imagine
2 CONC digging a well by hand four
2 CONT feet in diameter and fifteen to twenty feet deep!
2 CONT       The early pioneers did not have much money with which to buy
2 CONC coal, so wood had to be cut
2 CONT for that purpose.  That was always a good winter's job.
2 CONT       Field work was far different from the present, modern methods.
2 CONC Tractors were unheard of.
2 CONT The machinery was crude. The walking plow, the walking cultivator, the
2 CONC miniature reaper that
2 CONT left the grain untied were the common machines in use.  Years later
2 CONC the riding machinery became
2 CONT better known.  Shocking grain was a detestable job, especially barley,
2 CONC as the beards would lodge
2 CONT in your shirt and socks causing unending itching.
2 CONT       Since threshing machines were few we had to take our turn in
2 CONC getting our grain into the bins.
2 CONT This would be late in the fall.  It was not unusual to be threshing
2 CONC after the first snowfall.  In order
2 CONT to get the fall plowing done the grain had to be stacked in huge
2 CONC cone-shaped stacks, usually four
2 CONT to six stacks to a setting, then the plowing could be done with ease.
2 CONT       Threshing every fall was fascinating to us.  To see that
2 CONC enormous steam engine puffing black
2 CONT clouds of smoke was terrifying.  That smooth flowing power operated
2 CONC the separator with such
2 CONT ease that the straw came bellowing out of the blower in massive heaps
2 CONC to form a huge straw pile
2 CONT in which we loved to frolic-after the machine moved away.  The shrill
2 CONC whistle from the engine
2 CONT would penetrate our ears with deafening force.
2 CONT      When we heard Dad mention the approximate time the threshers
2 CONC would come to our farm,
2 CONT we would gaze through the schoolroom windows in eager anticipation of
2 CONC its arrival. When that
2 CONT time came we lost all interest in our school work. The teacher knew
2 CONC why we were so restless, but
2 CONT as long as we did not misbehave we were not scolded.  Our only concern
2 CONC was to rush home so we
2 CONT could ride the grain wagon with Dad to the field where the machine was
2 CONC in operation.  What a
2 CONT thrill! For several years we were fortunate in having the threshers at
2 CONC our place on our birthday.
2 CONT One such fall day stands out very vividly in my mind:  Selmer and I
2 CONC had gotten pocket knives
2 CONT with a chain to fasten them to our overall button for safety.  I can't
2 CONC recall any birthday present
2 CONT that was more appreciated than that knife.  To show our pride in that
2 CONC unexpected gift, we were
2 CONT anxious to follow Dad to the threshing crew so we could show off our
2 CONC treasured birthday present.
2 CONT Dad sensed our joy and understood our pride.
2 CONT      A greater attraction than the threshing machine was the cook-car.
2 CONC The inviting aroma
2 CONT surrounding the area was a beckoning call for us to survey the
2 CONC premises, I would dare Selmer; he
2 CONT would dare me to go close enough so that cooks would be aware that we
2 CONC were neared I would
2 CONT steal Close to the steps at the entrance, listening closely to find
2 CONC out in which end of the cook-car
2 CONT the ladies might be working.  When I thought they were in the opposite
2 CONC end, unmindful of us, I
2 CONT would peek in the doorway to explore what was going on.  As sure as I
2 CONC did I was caught by an
2 CONT unexpected gaze that jerked my head back in a jolting manner.  When
2 CONC the cooks sensed our
2 CONT sneaky intrusion they knew why we were there.  It wasn't long before
2 CONC they satisfied our curiosity
2 CONT by giving us a cookie or a doughnut.  Then we were happy and
2 CONC satisfied.
2 CONT      Dad was a man of sterling character.  He never imbibed in
2 CONC alcoholic beverages and never
2 CONT used any form of tobacco. He practiced what he preached, setting an
2 CONC example worthy to follow.
2 CONT He was always regular in attending church as was mother, and they
2 CONC expected the same of the
2 CONT children.
2 CONT           Mother and Dad read by the light of the kerosene lamp with a
2 CONC reflector attached to it.  The
2 CONT reading material included the Bible which was used daily, Decorah
2 CONC Posten (news) and
2 CONT Minneapolis Tidende, and the Dakota Farmer.  With Decorah Posten came
2 CONC Vedarnen, which was
2 CONT a tabloid that was more often read by neighbors because the
2 CONC exhilarating and hilarious (funnies)
2 CONT called "Ola and Per" became a frequent topic of conversation.  That
2 CONC was a scream!
2 CONT           The kerosene lamp was replaced by the Aladdin lamp which was
2 CONC a tremendous
2 CONT improvement.  Now we could see clearly from any area of the large
2 CONC kitchen instead of rushing
2 CONT to get to the limited spot illumined by the small lamp's reflector.
2 CONT           In 1918 Dad had electric lights installed in all the
2 CONC buildings.  What an extravagance!  Not
2 CONT so.  We had experienced some good years and Dad thought it would be a
2 CONC good investment, and
2 CONT that is what it turned out to be.  No longer was it necessary to clean
2 CONC lamp and lantern chimneys, a
2 CONT job which we disliked.  All that was necessary now was to press the
2 CONC button.  What a welcome
2 CONT change!  A large Genco generating plant furnished the power by storing
2 CONC it in 16 large glass
2 CONT batteries.  No more danger of fire in the barn that held 70 tons of
2 CONC hay; no more danger of a cow
2 CONT "jumping over the moon" because the lantern capsized.  By now we were
2 CONC comfortably situated so
2 CONT we could enjoy the comforts of the day.
2 CONT      Dark gloomy clouds of the first world war had hung on the horizon
2 CONC since 1914.  The
2 CONT United States was not involved until later.  In 1917-18 men were being
2 CONC drafted and ordered to
2 CONT military training camps.  Meanwhile people at home were busy making
2 CONC articles of clothing
2 CONT needed by the soldiers. The Bergen Charity Circle, of which we were
2 CONC members, met regularly for
2 CONT this purpose, and that was the time Mother taught me to knit.
2 CONT      The summer of 1918 caught Selmer and me in the army draft.  This
2 CONC was of great concern
2 CONT to the folks, fearing we would be called for military training.  We
2 CONC registered as soon as we were
2 CONT 18 years old which was three months before Armistice Day.  We were
2 CONC classified I-A which
2 CONT meant that we were physically fit for army training, and that we would
2 CONC be next in line to be called
2 CONT for camp duty.  The thought of our leaving home was not very pleasant
2 CONC for Mother and Dad, but
2 CONT their anxiety was soon alleviated when, within a matter of a few
2 CONC weeks, the Armistice, ending the
2 CONT war, was signed on November 11, 1918.
2 CONT           Since there was no refrigeration in the early part of the
2 CONC century, meat had to be cured to
2 CONT keep it from spoiling. Dad built a smokehouse for this purpose, using
2 CONC a 55 gallon oil drum.  The
2 CONT top of the drum was removed to allow the smoke to escape and penetrate
2 CONC the meat that was hung
2 CONT on the surrounding walls.  Again we had fun challenging each other,
2 CONC this time to see who could
2 CONT stay the longest in the smoke-filled house.  I don't know who won, but
2 CONC I know I came out
2 CONT choking and with eyes and nose running.  A slow-burning fire without
2 CONC flame cured the meat to a
2 CONT delectable taste.
2 CONT           Before hams could be smoked they were soaked in a brine
2 CONC solution in a large earthen crock
2 CONT for several days.  In this solution they would keep for weeks.
2 CONT      Dried beef was another variety of home-prepared meat. This had to
2 CONC be salted for a given
2 CONT time, then hung to dry. When ready, Dad wrapped it in cloth, put it in
2 CONC a sack and buried it in the
2 CONT grain bin.  Mutton prepared this way became "spekekjot," a favorite
2 CONC amongst Norwegians.
2 CONT           The large dried cod fish Dad bought occasionally had to be
2 CONC prepared in a special way
2 CONT before it could be cooked. Mother would put the cod in a large earthen
2 CONC crock filled with a salt
2 CONT and water mixture to which some lye had been added.  Before this
2 CONC "Lutefisk" was cooked, it was
2 CONT washed and again soaked in water.  Served with melted butter, mashed
2 CONC or boiled potatoes, it was
2 CONT a most delectable meal. Lefse was always a companion.
2 CONT           It was necessary to work if one wanted spending money.
2 CONC During the warm days of
2 CONT summer, Sam, Joe and I trapped gophers.  The county paid a two-cent
2 CONC bounty for tails.
2 CONT stuffedinto our overall pockets several slices of dried beef, and with
2 CONC our traps in hand took off to
2 CONT the pasture. There we spent the entire day trapping and relishing our
2 CONC dried beef dinner.
2 CONT           To keep the gopher tails intact we placed them in a snuff
2 CONC box discarded by our hired man.
2 CONT On Saturdays we would go with Dad to town and trade our "loot" for
2 CONC celluloid rings which we
2 CONT used for trimming the harnesses.
2 CONT           This became our weekly event in the summer, so much so that
2 CONC whenever the Knott boys
2 CONT saw us coming into the hardware store they would jokingly say: "Here
2 CONC come those pesky ring
2 CONT buyers."  That didn't bother us.  We were happy with our purchases,
2 CONC and next week we would go
2 CONT back for more.
2 CONT           The folks believed in giving us a good education that they
2 CONC were denied.  Parochial school
2 CONT was attended for a month following secular school.  Here memory work
2 CONC was paramount. The
2 CONT "Catechism," the "Forklaring" (explanation) and "Bible History" were
2 CONC memorized verbatim.  The
2 CONT last period in the afternoon consisted of writing from dictation
2 CONC several para-graphs dictated by
2 CONT the teacher from the "lesebok" (Reader). This required intense study
2 CONC because we were responsible
2 CONT for spelling and paragraphing, as well as diacritical markings.
2 CONT           Our noon recess was usually spent playing ball or crickets,
2 CONC but if we saw a gopher running
2 CONT in the school yard, we formed a water brigade, carried water from
2 CONC Uncle Sakris' nearby slough,
2 CONT poured it into the hole and waited for the gopher to come out.  Then
2 CONC with a stick or rock in our
2 CONT hands we would attack, many times too early or too late.  That was
2 CONC discouraging, so next time we
2 CONT used a snare made out of twine.  That was more effective.
2 CONC Our teacher's motto
2 CONT was"obedience."  We were expected to follow her rules to the letter.
2 CONC If we got out of hand once
2 CONT there would not be a second time.  Mother too expected wholehearted
2 CONC support.  If I had been
2 CONT reprimanded for some offense, the folks would surely find out, than I
2 CONC would get another censure
2 CONT when I got home.
2 CONT           That brings to mind another incident when Selmer and I had
2 CONC been given permission to go
2 CONT to Jake Fosheim's place to play with Jake and Art.  They were the only
2 CONC boys in the neighborhood
2 CONT that had a bicycle.  That intrigued us and was the main reason we
2 CONC wanted to be with them.
2 CONT Mother told us to be home at a certain time and she meant it.  That
2 CONC evening Selmer went at the
2 CONT precise time, but I was having too much fun with the bike to heed
2 CONC mother's order.  Later I wished
2 CONT I had, for when I got home mother applied something to that part of my
2 CONC anatomy that touches the
2 CONT chair when I sit down.  That taught me to respect her orders.
2 CONT      Sunday dinners were always special but usually late, not due to
2 CONC Mother's negligence, but
2 CONT rather because of the long-winded sermons by the preacher.  It was not
2 CONC uncommon to delay the
2 CONT dinner until one O'clock though the services began precisely at eleven
2 CONC o'clock.  If baptism,
2 CONT communion or confirmation were a part of the service, the dinner was
2 CONC further delayed.  To us as
2 CONT youngsters it often reached the point when we thought more about
2 CONC mother's good dinner awaiting
2 CONT us than of what transpired in church.  There was scarcely a Sunday
2 CONC that we did not have company
2 CONT for dinner. That was the price the folks paid for living so close to
2 CONC the church--only 80 rods away.
2 CONT We always enjoyed company, then mother might have a little something
2 CONC extra, but it just meant
2 CONT that rambunctious boys, eager to go out to play, had to wait till the
2 CONC grown-ups had been served.
2 CONT That was usually a very tedious wait.
2 CONT      Mother's generous heart never permitted anyone to go hungry.
2 CONC Meat,  vegetables,butter
2 CONT and eggs of which we had plenty, were given to the Pastor for the
2 CONC family's use.  At Thanksgiving
2 CONT time mother always had a large turkey ready for the parsonage together
2 CONC with freshly baked bread,
2 CONT cookies and pies.
2 CONT           Preparation for Christmas always started the first week in
2 CONC December.  School children
2 CONT from the various districts gathered at Bergen church on the first
2 CONC Saturday to be assigned their
2 CONT particular part in the program which con-sisted of poems, dialogues,
2 CONC songs and pantomimes, all
2 CONT to be memorized. When thus assigned we studied diligently for the next
2 CONC Saturday's practice.  The
2 CONT night assigned for the "Juletrefest" (Christmas Tree Festival) was the
2 CONC highlight of all the winter
2 CONT activities.  No one stayed home that night. Grandmas as well as
2 CONC new-born babes were there.
2 CONT Soon there was only standing room left.  When the program was over the
2 CONC children marched
2 CONT around the altar where each one was given a bag of candy and nuts; to
2 CONC our joy a nice red apple
2 CONT was added when we got back to our assigned seats.
2 CONT           Celebrating Christmas for at least two weeks required much
2 CONC time and planning.  Mother
2 CONT went all out to make it a joyous occasion for all of us.  Christmas
2 CONC Eve dinner was extra special.
2 CONT There was never a time we did not have a brand new oil cloth to deck
2 CONC the kitchen table although
2 CONT the present one would have served the purpose as well.  That special
2 CONC meal consisted of lutefisk,
2 CONT mashed potatoes with delicious brown gravy, spare-ribs, lefse,
2 CONC flatbread, fattigman, kringla,
2 CONT pickles, and all kinds of cookies and cake.  When supper was over the
2 CONC Christmas Story was read
2 CONT 3 followed with an evening prayer.  At an early age we were taught the
2 CONC true meaning of
2 CONT Christmas.
2 CONT           For several days following, the neighbors invited the young
2 CONC folks for a fun time which
2 CONT would be spent in singing, playing parlor games, and, of course,
2 CONC eating a delightful lunch.  This
2 CONT would go on far into the night.  We did our chore early so we could
2 CONC leave home right after
2 CONT supper, thus making the evening's fun last longer.  After two weeks of
2 CONC such exciting socializing,
2 CONT we were satisfied to get back to our regular routine.
2 CONT           Mother and Dad made their home on the farm until 1926 when
2 CONC they purchased a house and
2 CONT retired to Bristol.  Selmer, who had worked the farm for a few years,
2 CONC purchased the land and
2 CONT continued its operation.
2 CONT           There were nine children in our family.  Minnie was the
2 CONC first to survive after the death of
2 CONT the first four infants which included a pair of twins.  Minnie was
2 CONC born November 11, 1897,
2 CONT Selmer and I on September 17, 1899, Joel on May 17, 1902, and Clara on
2 CONC July 29, 1905.
2 CONT After a year's bout with pernicious anemia, Mother passed away on
2 CONC September 14, 1936 at the
2 CONT age of 72b years. After Mother's passing Dad made his home on the farm
2 CONC with Selmer and Elsie.
2 CONT He enjoyed being on the farm, staying there for several years before
2 CONC moving to Moorhead,
2 CONT Minnesota where he spent his remaining days with Joel and Clarice. He
2 CONC passed away on January 23, 1950 at 85 years of age.   Blessed be their
2 CONC memory.

2 CONT
2 CONT      The first child born to us was Duane Wesley who got his second
2 CONC name from his Mother's
2 CONT maiden name.  Duane was born at the Peabody Hospital in Webster, South
2 CONC Dakota, on March 8,
2 CONT 1925.  I was teaching the home school at the time. When the news came
2 CONC to me I rushed to the
2 CONT hospital immediately after school to see our first-born,a bouncing 8
2 CONC pound 12 ounce baby boy.
2 CONT What a thrill!  what a joy!  What a welcome member to the family.  He
2 CONC was a delight to care for,
2 CONT a privilege to instruct and an honor to have as our own.
2 CONT
2 CONT     His early schooling was done in several different places because
2 CONC of my various teaching
2 CONT positions.  He finished his grade school in the Webster school system.
2 CONC He was confirmed in St.
2 CONT John's Lutheran church in 1940 by Rev. Johan Kildahl.  In the fall of
2 CONC 1941 we moved to
2 CONT Moorhead, Minnesota where he began his high school training.  During
2 CONC his junior year he was
2 CONT drafted into the army. He joined the paratroop division and trained in
2 CONC Fort Bragg, North Carolina
2 CONT before going overseas.  He served as a motor-cycle patrolman in
2 CONC Marsailles, France for six
2 CONT months before going to Germany.  It was in one of the major battles
2 CONC (Battle of the Bulge) that he
2 CONT landed in an isolated area, away from his comrades, and when he was
2 CONC found by members of his
2 CONT battalion his feet were frozen, almost to the point of amputation.  He
2 CONC was evacuated to a hospital
2 CONT in London where he recuperated until he was released three days before
2 CONC V-Day.  On March 14,
2 CONT 1946 he was discharged from the service, arriving home from Camp
2 CONC McCoy, Wisconsin the same
2 CONT day.  The anticipation, the joy of having him home safely was not to
2 CONC be enjoyed very long.  On
2 CONT the 18th day of July he met sudden death in a tragic motorcycle
2 CONC accident on his way home from
2 CONT Wahpeton, North Dakota where he had gone with some friends to get
2 CONC repairs for a cycle that
2 CONT belonged to one of them. He was buried in Riverside Cemetery in
2 CONC Moorhead on July 22, 1946
2 CONT following services in Trinity church conducted by Rev. Roy
2 CONC Harrisville.
2 CONT           Why he was taken we cannot answer.  It is all in Divine
2 CONC hands.  I like to think when the
2 CONT young are called, that perhaps they are favored--perhaps they are
2 CONC called to add a spot of beauty--a needed flower in the Heavenly
2 CONC gardens--a blossom that will grow in a greater beauty there.

1 NOTE 	While attending summer school at Northern State Teachers' college in
2 CONC Aberdeen in the summer of 1927 I was called out of the classroom to
2 CONC answer a long-distance tele-phone call.
2 CONT When I heard the familiar voice of my cousin Selma Olson, I knew her
2 CONC reason for calling.  A
2 CONT registered nurse, she informed me that I had been blessed with my
2 CONC first baby daughter.  No more
2 CONT classes that day!  I rushed home to the farm where Freda was anxiously
2 CONC waiting.  There, for the
2 CONT first time, I saw my lovely daughter Joyce, and we both rejoiced in
2 CONC her arrival.  Now "Buddy"
2 CONT would have a playmate.
2 CONT           Growing up for her was not difficult.  With her ready smile
2 CONC and winsome persnality she
2 CONT was a delightful addition to the family.  At school she won friends
2 CONC easily because she spread joy
2 CONT wherever she went.  Kids were attracted to her, so it was not unusual
2 CONC to have a yard full of them
2 CONT after school.  They were always welcome because we enjoyed them too.
2 CONT           The thought of leaving schoolmates and friends in Webster
2 CONC was rather frightening at her
2 CONT age, but when we had settled in Moorhead Joyce made friends so quickly
2 CONC that the adjustment was really no problem.
2 CONT           After high school Joyce attended Concordia College for a
2 CONC year with teaching in mind,
2 CONT however,since they did not have a strong teachers' training course,
2 CONC she switched to Moorhead
2 CONT State to get her teaching certificate.  She taught at Redwood Falls
2 CONC and Robbinsdale, Minnesota.
2 CONT           In the summer of 1952 she married Walter Evenson whom she
2 CONC had met while attending
2 CONT Concordia College, and who had just completed seminary training.  In
2 CONC the fall of 1955 they flew
2 CONT to Africa where they served as Missionaries in the British East Africa
2 CONC area.  After nearly five
2 CONT years there they returned home where Pastor Evenson served several
2 CONC parishes.  They have eight children and now live in Stover, Missouri.
2 CONT      Due to Freda's loss of hearing, aggravated by the rampant "Flu,"
2 CONC she was advised by her
2 CONT uncle, Dr. M. D. Westley, not to have any more children.  Time went on
2 CONC for seven years when we
2 CONT yearned to have another child.  This time I was teaching school in
2 CONC Lily, South Dakota.  On June
2 CONT 4th, 1934, I was called to the hospital in Bradley, South Dakota where
2 CONC I experienced another
2 CONT added joy as I watched Mother cuddling our darling Mary June to her
2 CONC breast. Buddy and Joyce
2 CONT were delighted with the news and could hardly wait for her arrival
2 CONC home.

1 NOTE Thoughts of Daniel J. Sigdestad, 1982
2 CONT
2 CONT           It was extremely difficult to continue our usual way of life
2 CONC without the thought of having
2 CONT Buddy with us.  We tried to cope with the loss in a realistic way, but
2 CONC the memories could not be
2 CONT erased.  Time may dim them but they are not eradicated.
2 CONT           In the course of the year that followed, the thought of
2 CONC adopting a boy constantly entered
2 CONT our minds to the point that we could not erase it.  After long,
2 CONC thoughtful delibera-tions we
2 CONT contacted the Lutheran Welire Society in St. Paul about adoption
2 CONC procedures.  They were glad to
2 CONT oblige and contacts were readily established.
2 CONT           By now our deliberations became anxious anticipations of
2 CONC what was to become a life-long
2 CONT relationship far beyond our meager expectations.  We drove to St. Paul
2 CONC to contact the case worker
2 CONT who, after a friendly business visit, asked us to follow her into the
2 CONC room where the children were
2 CONT gathered.  Unobtrusively we entered the room and watched the children
2 CONC at play without their
2 CONT being aware of our reason for being there, other than the case worker
2 CONC was showing us around.
2 CONT      Little did Curtis realize that we had selected him as the one we
2 CONC would be happy and anxious
2 CONT to adopt into our family.  While we mingled amongstthe group talking,
2 CONC first to this one, then to
2 CONT that one, the case worker asked Curtis to come over to her.  He came
2 CONC at once.  she handed him a
2 CONT book and asked me to help him read it.  Willingly, without hesitation
2 CONC he came, sat on my lap as
2 CONT we began by looking at the pictures.  It was notlong before I had his
2 CONC entire attention.  That did
2 CONT it--I was thoroughly convinced that we had selected the right one.
2 CONC That was the begining of the
2 CONT adoption process.
2 CONT           From time to time the caseworker made periodic visits to our
2 CONC home, studying us as
2 CONT adoptive parents, familiarizing herself with our life-style, our
2 CONC character, our integrity as well as
2 CONT our ability to provide a good home.  Time went on; more visits to our
2 CONC home, why so many we did
2 CONT not know, but the day came, however, when the adoption procedure could
2 CONC be consummated, and
2 CONT for us it could not come too soon because it had already been a long
2 CONC routine.  Eventually the
2 CONT adoption was finalized.  On October 23rd, 1954 he became ours.
2 CONT           On the way home from St. Paul, Curtis found the road to be
2 CONC endlessly long.  "How many
2 CONT miles do we have left?" and "Are we soon in Moorhead? He was asked
2 CONC more than once.  He
2 CONT fought sleep but finally gave up when we were an hour from home.  When
2 CONC we woke him from his
2 CONT sleep, he wasted no time surveying his new surroundings.  This was his
2 CONC home enceforth.
2 CONT           On our way to Sunday school that first Sunday Freda said it
2 CONC was so nice to see Curtis and
2 CONT me walking together as we left the house.  She sensed the pride that
2 CONC was ours to once again have
2 CONT a son who filled that hither to void that had plagued us.  Curtis
2 CONC filled that beautifully.  We were
2 CONT mighty proud as parents too, for in him we found added joy and
2 CONC comradeship.  His magnetic
2 CONT personality, friendliness and happy disposition won him friends, both
2 CONC young and old.
2 CONT           After grade school, he attended and graduated from Oak Grove
2 CONC Lutheran High School
2 CONT where he was active in athletics.  He was also active in the Naval
2 CONC Reserves and as such would be
2 CONT required to have two years of active training at a naval base.  After
2 CONC two years at the San Diego
2 CONT Naval Training Center he enrolled at Concordia College where he
2 CONC received a Bachelor of Science
2 CONT degree in Biology.  The following fall, with the aid of a grant, he
2 CONC enrolled at the North Dakota
2 CONT State University where he continued his studies in science for a year
2 CONC and received his Masters
2 CONT Degree.  By now he had gotten a grant to continue his studies, this
2 CONC time at the University of Iowa
2 CONT in Iowa City where he was awarded his Ph.D. in Radiation Biology.
2 CONC Upon completion of his
2 CONT studies he served two years in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania before going
2 CONC to Louisville, Kentucky
2 CONT where he continues his Cancer Research work.
2 CONT           We are humbly grateful for his achievements, his loyalty to
2 CONC us and to his work.  Little did
2 CONT we realize what happiness and satisfaction was awaiting us as we
2 CONC ventured on that journey
2 CONT together.
2 CONT           I have been singularly blessed.  If I feel that what God has
2 CONC taken from me is indispensable,
2 CONT I must be cognizant of the fact that He never takes more than He gives
2 CONC in return.

2 CONT Early Days of Rasmus Sigdestad (written by him in
2 CONT 1955)
2 CONT
2 CONT 	I was born in Opstryn, Nordfjord, Norway on February 8,
2 CONT 1868, and came to the United States in July of 1881, settling at
2 CONT Montevideo, Minnesota. My father and mother, and two
2 CONT sisters and two brothers came to Montevideo. Another sister
2 CONT went to Wells, Minnesota. Yellow Medicine County, where we
2 CONT settled, was quite new. The homes were one-room log houses,
2 CONT or sod houses dug into a side hill. My parents moved into a
2 CONT sod house a few weeks before the harvest of 1881.
2 CONT
2 CONT 	In the winters I helped farmers do their chores for my
2 CONT board and room. If there was some spare time I went to school.
2 CONT I had less than six months schooling in this country. My
2 CONT parents wanted all of us to have Christian training, and in 1882
2 CONT I was confirmed in Bergen Church in Yellow Medicine County,
2 CONT Minnesota.
2 CONT
2 CONT 	One of my sisters married Iver Skaare. They decided to
2 CONT go west and look for a free homestead. Another family by the
2 CONT name of Erik Winson decided to go too. They each had a team
2 CONT of oxen and a few cows. I went along, chasing the cows
2 CONT behind the covered wagons. We left in May of 1884 with
2 CONT Webster, Dakota Territory, as our destination.
2 CONT
2 CONT 	It took us a week to go from Montevideo to Webster. I
2 CONT remember we came to Webster toward evening. We drove to a
2 CONT place which is now called the Bierschbach corner and camped
2 CONT there overnight. After we had our supper, Erik Winson and I
2 CONT walked uptown. There were a hundred or more Negro soldiers
2 CONT in town. There was a saloon and I guess they had been in
2 CONT there, for most of them were very drunk. The next morning all
2 CONT the soldiers marched to Fort Sisseton.
2 CONT
2 CONT 	We drove out to Lynn Lake. Erik Winson had a brother
2 CONT who had proven up a quarter of land. The brother had built a
2 CONT small house but had gone back to Minnesota. He told Erik that
2 CONT they could stay in the house as long as they wished. The two
2 CONT families stayed there while Iver and Erik went looking for land
2 CONT around Lynn Lake. It was pretty well claimed by others so
2 CONT they hired John Tofley to help locate land. The Tofleys had
2 CONT been here two or three years and were acquainted. After some
2 CONT searching they found several sections in the southwest corner
2 CONT of Lynn Township. Skaare and Winson each picked out a
2 CONT quarter which they planned to file for homestead, but when
2 CONT they came to the land office they were told that the land
2 CONT Winson had chosen was already claimed or proved up.
2 CONT Winson then went north and found land four miles farther
2 CONT north and filed for a quarter there.
2 CONT
2 CONT 	My father, Sakris, came here the fall of 1884 and filed on a
2 CONT quarter next to my brother-in-law Iver Skaare. The spring of
2 CONT 1885 my parents moved to this quarter of land. I was too
2 CONT young to file on any land, so I went back to Minnesota and
2 CONT worked for my brother-in-law, Magnus Olson, for $110 a year.
2 CONT With the $110 I bought two three-year-old steers and one cow.
2 CONT I drove them to Dakota. I sold them steers to my father who
2 CONT broke them and used them as oxen for many years, and I sold
2 CONT the cow to a neighbor. Farm work was hard to get so I went to
2 CONT Andover, where the railroad was being built from Andover to
2 CONT North Dakota. It was spring and we had a lot of rain and cold
2 CONT weather. Workers had to sleep in tents. In early summer my
2 CONT brother John, two other boys, and myself went west of Groton
2 CONT to work for two big farmers who were brothers. They were
2 CONT wheat farmers. They used four binders with two men shocking
2 CONT behind each binder. We got $1.25 a day working from about
2 CONT seven a.m. to sundown. We thought we made good money.
2 CONT
2 CONT 	After harvest I went back to Minnesota. The spring of
2 CONT 1888 I worked for a farmer. For eight months work I was paid
2 CONT $140. With this money I bought two three-year-old mare colts
2 CONT which I drove to Lynn Township, and sold to my brother John.
2 CONT He filed on 80 acres that bordered my father's land.
2 CONT
2 CONT 	In 1889 I came of age and that fall I bought a
2 CONT relinquishment to a tree claim from Rasmus Larson. About 15
2 CONT acres were broken and I seeded my first crop the spring of
2 CONT 1890. I had a team of horses and I broke up as much for field as
2 CONT I could. This was the first land I owned. As time went on I
2 CONT bought more land.
2 CONT
2 CONT 	On July 1, 1899 I married Anna Marie Gudahl of Faribault
2 CONT County, Minnesota. We bought an unfinished house and
2 CONT moved it to the present farm stead. The summer of 1900 we
2 CONT built an addition to the house and later built the farm
2 CONT buildings.
2 CONT
2 CONT 	Our marriage was blest with six children; three boys,
2 CONT Steward, Clarence, and Rueben; and three girls, Selma,
2 CONT Esther, and Agnes. One boy Rueben died in infancy.
2 CONT
2 CONT 	I am the only one left of my family. My brothers John and
2 CONT Sakris, and three sisters; Kristina, Mrs. Magnus Olson; Kari,
2 CONT Mrs. John Grove; and Ingebor, Mrs. Iver Skaare, are deceased
2 CONT and buried in Bergen Cemetery in Lynn Township.
2 CONT
2 CONT 	My wife Anna passed away December 21, 1954. We
2 CONT had 55 years together. Along with the hardships we had
2 CONT many happy times. God has been very good to us. He has
2 CONT blessed us in many ways
