This repository is for the Day county, South Dakota, USGenWeb Project.

## Site Hosting History

This site was originally created in 1997 by Curt Sigdestad
as part of [The USGenWeb Project](https://www.usgenweb.org/)
and hosted at RootsWeb. Elliot Huntington volunteered to maintain 
the website in 2014, which was a relief to Curt as he was looking 
for someone else to take over his responsibilities as the Day county 
coordinator. At that time the website was moved to be hosted on the
South Dakota USGenWeb server. With time, Google started reporting this 
site as "not secured" simply because it was not served using the https 
protocol. In an effort to encourage community involvement and enable 
serving the content over https for free, the decision was made to host 
this site and its content on GitHub.
