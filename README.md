# daycountysouthdakotagenweb.github.io
This repository is for the Day county, South Dakota, USGenWeb Project.

## Site Hosting History

This site was originally created in 1997 by Curt Sigdestad
as part of [The USGenWeb Project](https://www.usgenweb.org/)
and hosted at: 

<div style="display: inline"> 
    https://sites.rootsweb.com/~sdday/ 
</div>
 
Elliot Huntington volunteered to help with the website in 2013, which was
a relief to Curt as he was looking for someone else to take over his
responsibilities as the county coordinator. At that time the website was 
moved to be hosted at: 

<div style="display: inline"> 
    http://day.sdgenweb.com/ 
</div>


With time, Google started reporting this site as "not secured" because it 
was served over http instead of https. Rather than paying for an SSL 
certificate to fix this issue, and to encourage more community involvement
to update the site, the decision was made to store and host the site
on GitHub.
