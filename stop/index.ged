2 CONT
2 CONT Francis Joseph Stoppel (7-14-1811 to 6-26-1898)
2 CONT
2 CONT 	George and Margaretha (Spath) Stoppel of  Hiltenzweiler Parish,
2 CONC Wurtenburg, Germany, (now Wuerttemberg, West Germany) were the parents
2 CONC of five children.  (One source has Julianna Eisenbach von
2 CONC Doporetseillen as the wife of George Stoppel.  Another source
2 CONC translates the baptimal certificate as saying that she was only a
2 CONC witness to the baptism).   Katharina (11 Mar 1806); Elisabetha (5 Oct
2 CONC 1807) and Xavier (4 Jul 1809) remained in Germany while Franz Joseph
2 CONC (14 Jul 1811) and George Jr., (11 Nov 1813)  came to the United
2 CONC States.
2 CONT
2 CONT 	Joseph, as a young man, learned the bricklaying and stone masonry
2 CONC trade he then served in the German Army for six years.  His honorary
2 CONC discharge to recorded as April 1st, 1838. (Mr. and Mrs. Ralph Stoppel
2 CONC have his discharge papers and his baptismal certificate.) The George
2 CONC Stoppel, Sr., family were members of a Catholic Churoh In Wurttemburg.
2 CONT
2 CONT 	In 1845 Joseph came to the United States, he went to Cincinnati, Ohio
2 CONC in 1848.  There he pursued his trade and did some farming.  He married
2 CONC Maria E. Schwab on February 6. 1846.  She was the daughter of Han
2 CONC Jacob Schwab and Elizabeth Pflugshaupt from Kallnach, Switzerland.
2 CONC She was the thrid child of 10 children in that family.  Four of
2 CONC Joseph's & Marie's  nine children were born In Cincinnati.
2 CONT
2 CONT 	In 1856 Joseph and his younger brother, George, Jr., took their
2 CONC families by  oxcart to Rochester, Minnesota, They shared an oxcart
2 CONC between them. everyone walked except the two wives and the youngest
2 CONC children.  The two families staked their claims on a long, low hill
2 CONC about three miles southwest of the settlement.  After setting up a
2 CONC temporary house the two sons walked to LaCrosse, Wisconsin, to file
2 CONC their status at the land office.  Each paid $200.00 for his one
2 CONC hundred sixty acre farm.  Francis took the west half of the hill and
2 CONC George took the east.  The round trip from LaCrosse took three days.
2 CONT
2 CONT 	Joseph dug a cave in the side of the hill where the two families
2 CONC lived for the first winter.  Joesph's fifth son, Charles, was born in
2 CONC the cave on March 16, 1857.  In the Summer of 1857 a log cabin was
2 CONC constructed by each man.  Joseph and his family began to farm some of
2 CONC their land and began to build a stone house.
2 CONT
2 CONT 	Joseph built the first kiln in Olmsted County.  The limestone was
2 CONC quarried from an adjacent hill.  This fire in the blast furnace was
2 CONC kept going day and night.  This meant that someone had to get up each
2 CONC night to add more fuel to the fire.  The limestone was used in many
2 CONC buildings and residences.  Coles Mill, the Commercial Hotel, and
2 CONC possibly Fugels Mill all used limestone that was from the Stoppel
2 CONC kiln.  Eventually the kiln was abandoned and fell into ruin.
2 CONT
2 CONT 		The stone for the house was quarried out of an adjacent hill.  The
2 CONC house was not completed until 1859.  The limestone was quarried and
2 CONC then refined in a kiln that the family had built.  The house is now
2 CONC the oldest permanent residence in the county and is the current home
2 CONC of the Olmsted County Historical Society.
2 CONT
2 CONT
2 CONT 	For some time the house was also used as a school.  The first teacher
2 CONC was the daughter of Judge Buckley.  As a result, the house also became
2 CONC a social center.  Many tines neighbors and friends would appear at the
2 CONC house unexpectedly.  Dances, card games,, quilting bees,, and other
2 CONC forms of recreation were hold frequently.
2 CONT
2 CONT 	Frank, Joseph's youngest surviving child, later wrote that on
2 CONC infrequent occasions Indians would stop at the house to trade trinkets
2 CONC for sugar and salt.  In 1867 a diphtheria epidemic swept through
2 CONC southeastern Minnesota.   Many people were stricken and died,
2 CONC including two of Joseph's children.
2 CONT
2 CONT 	George, Jr., also lost two children.  The dead were buried at night
2 CONC in unmarked graves on the property lines between the two homesteads.
2 CONC They were buried without coffins.  The exact location of the graves is
2 CONC unknown.
2 CONT
2 CONT 	Joseph divided his land between his sons.  In return the sons were to
2 CONC support their parents until they died.  At the time of the division he
2 CONC held over five hundred acres of farm land.  This practice was common
2 CONC in Germany and was followed to some extent in the US.  George Jr.,
2 CONC also made a similar division and this caused a legal problem and an
2 CONC eventual lawsuit.
2 CONT
2 CONT 	On Sunday, June 26, 1898 Joseph died.  He had gone for a walk to see
2 CONC his son Charles before going to church.  When he returned he
2 CONC complained of feeling weak.  A doctor was sent for and arrieved at
2 CONC 9:00 am.  At 9:20 Joseph died.  The cause of death was recorded as
2 CONC apoplexy.  Rev. Ward Bringham officiated at the funeral.  Joseph was
2 CONC buried in Oakwood Cemetery in Rochester.
2 CONT
2 CONT 	On March 7, 1910, Marie, his widow, died.  She was buried next to her
2 CONC husband.  Marie was 87 years old.  Rev. W.W. Bunge officiated at her
2 CONC funeral.  Death was attributed to old age.  The couple were parents of

1 NOTE SSDI has Charles birth year 1853, which is likely incorrect.  Birth
2 CONC certificate indicates 1857 as the birth year.
2 CONT
2 CONT In boyhood, Charlie attended school at the Stoppel home and later in
2 CONC Bamber Valley.  He cut wood, hauled it to Rochester, and sold it for
2 CONC fuel to Rochester businesses.  At 18, he started out with a threshing
2 CONC outfit and threshed every fall until he was 78 years old.  First he
2 CONC used a horse powered thresher, then steam, and later various kinds of
2 CONC gasoline engines and tractors.
2 CONT 	Charlie met Sophia Agnes Regina Strobel and later married her on
2 CONC September 29, 1888.  She was born on March 10, 1867, in Ramson,
2 CONC Illinois.  She was baptized on August 18, 1878, and confirmed October
2 CONC 18, 1878, in Dwight, Illinois, at Immanuel Lutheran Church.  She came
2 CONC to Minnesota with her father, Freidrich (Fred) and her stepmother in
2 CONC 1885.
2 CONT 	Sophia's father, Fred, was born on April 26, 1840, in Ligmaringen,
2 CONC Prussia.  He was 14 years old when he came to the United States.  On
2 CONC September 8, 1861, he enlisted into the Union Army, Company C 15th
2 CONC U.S. Infantry, in the Civil War as a private.  At the close of his
2 CONC three-year enlistment, he re-enlisted, serving the whole war.  He was
2 CONC twice wounded in the head and once in the leg.  At one time, a New
2 CONC Testament, which he carried over his heart, saved his life because it
2 CONC stopped a bullet.  He took part in engagements at Dogwalk, Stone
2 CONC Ridge, Gettysburg, Shiloh, Siege of Corinth, Chicamauga, Missionary
2 CONC Ridge, Ringgold, Tunnel Hill, and Sherman's march to the sea.  After
2 CONC his first wife (Sophia's mother), Christine Kumpf (born in 1841 in
2 CONC Wessen Darstadt, Germany) died in 1876, at age 35, Fred remarried to
2 CONC Albertine Machmann on October 24, 1876.  He worked as a blacksmith and
2 CONC farmer after moving to Minnesota.  He died in Rochester on January 5,
2 CONC 1922, at age 81.  Albertine died on April 17, 1948.
2 CONT 	Sophia's brother, Otto (born December 12, 1865) stayed in Ramson,
2 CONC Illinois.  He died on January 9, 1937.  One brother, Charles (born
2 CONC 1873) had died in 1875.  Sophia's half sisters and brothers included:
2 CONC Bertha Strobel Chase (born September 1, 1877), Elizabeth Strobel Dale
2 CONC (born May 23, 1879), Fred (born November 11, 1880), Lena Strobel
2 CONC Langton (born April 3, 1882), Josephine Strobel Richards (born June
2 CONC 29, 1884), Dora Strobel Case (born March 28, 1889), Herman (born
2 CONC December 21, 1890), and Edna Strobel Ledder (born September 11, 1893).
2 CONT 	Charlie and Sophia lived on the farm land his father divided in 1893.
2 CONC This was 90 acres along Salem Road, known as the old Enke farm.  This
2 CONC was formerly owned by Fred Enke and later sold to Michael Hohler from
2 CONC which Francis bought the farm.  It had a stone house built in 1857 by
2 CONC Mr. Enke and a log barn and sheds.  Charlie built the present barn in
2 CONC 1890 and the house in 1892.  The silo was built in 1915.  In 1917,
2 CONC they were able to get electricity, and shared a meter with Dr. Charles
2 CONC H. Mayo.  The garage was built in 1924.  In 1929, the old stone house
2 CONC was torn down, and the stone was used in building the dam on Dr. D. C.
2 CONC Balfour's farm on the Zumbro River.
2 CONT 	Charlie and Sophia had six children:  Otto Charles, Roy Robert, Ralph
2 CONC Fred, Freda, Laura, and Helen Mae.  They farmed for a living.  They
2 CONC were active in all community affairs in the school and the township.
2 CONC He was a treasurer for the Bamber Valley School Board for 43 years
2 CONC (1896-1939) and treasurer for the town board for 10 years (1927-1937).
2 CONC He was also an appraiser for the Rochester Farmers Mutual Insurance
2 CONC Company.  He was "road master" also, so he maintained the roads before
2 CONC the county did.

2 CONT                                              (by Hazel Markham)
2 CONT
2 CONT 	Someone asked that I write about the people, not just their
2 CONC birthdays, etc. I could not do that about other members of this family
2 CONC about whom I know so little. However, I am going to write this little
2 CONC bit about two that I did know well. Perhaps others will add their
2 CONC stories to our history.
2 CONT
2 CONT 	I first met the Bernie Markham family in 1946 when Bill brought me to
2 CONC visit them in their home on the farm in Section 10 of Oronoco
2 CONC Township. They lived on a 170-acre farm; at that time, it was a real
2 CONC working farm. True, they didn't have horses anymore, but they had them
2 CONC not long before. Bernie loved those horses, and it nearly broke his
2 CONC heart to let them go. But farmers were finding tractors were more
2 CONC efficient, and horses no longer earned their keep. Hard as it was,
2 CONC Bernie had to sell his horses. I remember how lovingly he talked about
2 CONC his horses. He showed me where he used to pasture them just east of
2 CONC the house, and he showed me where he kept them in the barn. He talked
2 CONC about his horses and the equipment he used with great joy and pride.
2 CONC He often told me stories about the horses he had over the years.
2 CONC Bernie made a big hit with me. He was very kind to me. He had a great
2 CONC sense of humor. He loved to tease me, but he also showed me lots of
2 CONC respect. One thing I remember was how he built me a "whatchamacallit"
2 CONC to step on when I went down into the basement which always seemed to
2 CONC have water on the floor. By that time Bill, I, and Jeannine lived in
2 CONC their house on the farm and Bernie and Mabel had retired and moved to
2 CONC a house in Oronoco. Another time, Bernie came up to the farm and found
2 CONC me chopping down weeds in back of the house. The weeds had got way out
2 CONC of hand and I was whapping away with a little weed whacker when the
2 CONC handle broke in two. Bernie said he would take it home and fix it.
2 CONC Well, he brought it back later, and he had put the cutter on the end
2 CONC of a pipe. He told me that he had said to Mabel, "that woman is trying
2 CONC to chop down trees with this little thing." Bernie always took an
2 CONC interest in the new house when we started building in 1968. He wasn't
2 CONC well enough anymore to help with the work, but he came up and watched
2 CONC and delighted in the way things were going. He liked to watch me tell
2 CONC the builders what I wanted. Bill was gone so much in those days
2 CONC hauling milk and then milking cows before and after the routes, that I
2 CONC was the straw boss on the building of the house. He helped a lot with
2 CONC it whenever he could, but since I had dreamed about it the longest and
2 CONC planned the most, he let me make most of the decisions. I guess that
2 CONC is only fair because I was to spend the most time in the house.
2 CONC Anyway, I was sad that Bernie was too ill to see us actually move into
2 CONC the house; he would have enjoyed that. We moved in on March 19, 1969,
2 CONC after Bernie was in the nursing home. Bernie died April 19, 1969. I
2 CONC had a dream after he died in which I saw Bernie coming across the
2 CONC field on a big horse. As he came by me, he waved. He looked so happy.
2 CONC I believe that he had to be in Heaven because he wouldn't be that
2 CONC happy otherwise. I am glad because I hope to see him again some day.
2 CONT 	I also have wonderful memories of Mabel. She was a grand lady. She
2 CONC loved all of us whether we were her own or married into the family. I
2 CONC was only 16 when I met her and there were a few holes in my cooking
2 CONC education. Mabel taught me much about cooking, raising a family, and
2 CONC many other skills; but the most important thing she taught me was how
2 CONC to entertain. She had a get-together every holiday and birthday and
2 CONC lots of times in between. She always welcomed each and every member of
2 CONC the family, friends, and anyone else who came.  She made the best
2 CONC bread, cakes, candy, doughnuts, cinnamon rolls, and cookies anyone
2 CONC ever tasted. I know better than anyone what a great mother she was,
2 CONC because she raised one of the greatest sons in the world. Other wives
2 CONC may disagree with me on that one, but this is my story. Mabel lived 13
2 CONC years after Bernie died.  She missed him terribly. After she died, the
2 CONC minister told us "she has gone to live in one of God's mansions." I
2 CONC bet she is counting noses right now to see how many places to set at
2 CONC the table. We will always remember her with love. Someday, when the
2 CONC time is right, we will see her again.
