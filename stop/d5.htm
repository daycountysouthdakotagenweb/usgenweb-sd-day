 THE FRANCIS JOSEPH STOPPEL FAMILY
<BR>

<BR>
Francis Joseph Stoppel (7-14-1811 to 6-26-1898)
<BR>

<BR>
	George and Margaretha (Spath) Stoppel of  Hiltenzweiler Parish, Wurtenburg,
Germany, (now Wuerttemberg, West Germany) were the parents of five children.
 (One source has Julianna Eisenbach von Doporetseillen as the wife of George
Stoppel.  Another source translates the baptimal certificate as saying that she
was only a witness to the baptism).   Katharina (11 Mar 1806); Elisabetha (5
Oct 1807) and Xavier (4 Jul 1809) remained in Germany while Franz Joseph (14
Jul 1811) and George Jr., (11 Nov 1813)  came to the United States.  
<BR>

<BR>
	Joseph, as a young man, learned the bricklaying and stone masonry trade he then
served in the German Army for six years.  His honorary discharge to recorded
as April 1st, 1838. (Mr. and Mrs. Ralph Stoppel have his discharge papers and
his baptismal certificate.) The George Stoppel, Sr., family were members of a
Catholic Churoh In Wurttemburg.
<BR>

<BR>
	In 1845 Joseph came to the United States, he went to Cincinnati, Ohio in 1848.
 There he pursued his trade and did some farming.  He married Maria E. Schwab
on February 6. 1846.  She was the daughter of Han Jacob Schwab and Elizabeth
Pflugshaupt from Kallnach, Switzerland.  She was the thrid child of 10 children
in that family.  Four of Joseph's &amp; Marie's  nine children were born In Cincinnati.
<BR>

<BR>
	In 1856 Joseph and his younger brother, George, Jr., took their families by
 oxcart to Rochester, Minnesota, They shared an oxcart between them. everyone
walked except the two wives and the youngest children.  The two families staked
their claims on a long, low hill about three miles southwest of the settlement.
 After setting up a temporary house the two sons walked to LaCrosse, Wisconsin,
to file their status at the land office.  Each paid $200.00 for his one hundred
sixty acre farm.  Francis took the west half of the hill and George took the
east.  The round trip from LaCrosse took three days.
<BR>

<BR>
	Joseph dug a cave in the side of the hill where the two families lived for the
first winter.  Joesph's fifth son, Charles, was born in the cave on March 16,
1857.  In the Summer of 1857 a log cabin was constructed by each man.  Joseph
and his family began to farm some of their land and began to build a stone house.
<BR>

<BR>
	Joseph built the first kiln in Olmsted County.  The limestone was quarried from
an adjacent hill.  This fire in the blast furnace was kept going day and night.
 This meant that someone had to get up each night to add more fuel to the fire.
 The limestone was used in many buildings and residences.  Coles Mill, the Commercial
Hotel, and possibly Fugels Mill all used limestone that was from the Stoppel
kiln.  Eventually the kiln was abandoned and fell into ruin.
<BR>

<BR>
		The stone for the house was quarried out of an adjacent hill.  The house was
not completed until 1859.  The limestone was quarried and then refined in a kiln
that the family had built.  The house is now the oldest permanent residence in
the county and is the current home of the Olmsted County Historical Society.
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
	For some time the house was also used as a school.  The first teacher was the
daughter of Judge Buckley.  As a result, the house also became a social center.
 Many tines neighbors and friends would appear at the house unexpectedly.  Dances,
card games,, quilting bees,, and other forms of recreation were hold frequently.
<BR>
	
<BR>
	Frank, Joseph's youngest surviving child, later wrote that on infrequent occasions
Indians would stop at the house to trade trinkets for sugar and salt.  In 1867
a diphtheria epidemic swept through southeastern Minnesota.   Many people were
stricken and died, including two of Joseph's children.
<BR>

<BR>
	George, Jr., also lost two children.  The dead were buried at night in unmarked
graves on the property lines between the two homesteads.  They were buried without
coffins.  The exact location of the graves is unknown.
<BR>

<BR>
	Joseph divided his land between his sons.  In return the sons were to support
their parents until they died.  At the time of the division he held over five
hundred acres of farm land.  This practice was common in Germany and was followed
to some extent in the US.  George Jr., also made a similar division and this
caused a legal problem and an eventual lawsuit.
<BR>

<BR>
	On Sunday, June 26, 1898 Joseph died.  He had gone for a walk to see his son
Charles before going to church.  When he returned he complained of feeling weak.
 A doctor was sent for and arrieved at 9:00 am.  At 9:20 Joseph died.  The cause
of death was recorded as apoplexy.  Rev. Ward Bringham officiated at the funeral.
 Joseph was buried in Oakwood Cemetery in Rochester.
<BR>

<BR>
	On March 7, 1910, Marie, his widow, died.  She was buried next to her husband.
 Marie was 87 years old.  Rev. W.W. Bunge officiated at her funeral.  Death was
attributed to old age.  The couple were parents of nine children
