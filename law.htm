<p class=MsoNormal><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">        </span>Just when the
control of the action of individuals, through the operation <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>of law, had its genesis in South Dakota may not again be
known, but certain it <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>is that the Rees and the Sioux had well defined codes of
common law which <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>extended to most of the relations of their simple lives
treating of marriage and <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>divorce, the rights of property, for the protection of game,
the preservation of <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>peace, and the observance of these laws was exacted with a
fidelity unknown to <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>modern days in our civilized society.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>No rule was adopted not essential to the <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>happiness of the community, but the thing upon which public
happiness was <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>dependent must be observed at every cost.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The administration of these laws were <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>somewhat dependent upon the character of the matter at
issue.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Every camp had <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>its policeman, appointed at the pleasure of the chief, and
the enforcement of <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the law, as it affected petty offenses, was left to his
arbitrary will. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Quarrels, especially between women and children, little
infractions of good <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>morals, lie punished summarily with a cuff, a shake, or, in
case of <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>incorrigibles, by more severe punishment. He was judge, jury
and executioner. In <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the more serious cases the matter was tried out in council
and the punishment <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>fixed by the council, and if a capital offense, the entire
tribe took a hand in <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the execution. These tribal councils, in which the head men,
with much dignity <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>and circumstance, sat down to enquire into an alleged
offense against the common <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>law of the tribe, and to mete out the character of the
punishment if the <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>conviction ensued from the testimony, were the primitive
courts of South Dakota.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The inquest by council, however, appears to have been
employed only when there <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>was doubt of the guilt of the accused. When law was openly
broken within the <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>view of the tribe, the punishment was summarily administered
by the people. Or, <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>if the wrong was personal to some member of the tribe, he
was left to take his <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>own revenge, or to accept such reparation as could be agreed
upon between the <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>parties. The council, however, frequently assessed civil
damages.<o:p></o:p></p>

the Missouri, was <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>not within any civil jurisdiction. Though they arbitrarily
arrested and tried <o:p></o:p></p>

justified his action, though <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>he took fright and went to Mexico. Had he kept his nerve and

<p class=MsoNormal>fact is, that it was necessary for the post commandant to
dispense justice with <o:p></o:p></p>

sentenced by these <o:p></o:p></p>
