settlers came including the Sig­destads, Ole Bakken, Ole Simonson and many
others. These peo­ple all formed one community. One day after the Groves found
<span class=GramE>them­selves</span> fairly well settled they had a visitor, a
man by the name of Shultz. Shultz arrived with his 4 horses and a breaking plow
and starting breaking on the Grove land. They tried to tell him the land was
theirs, but it was of no use as he claimed the same.</p>

land. Mrs. Grove tried to find out who this man was and where he lived. She
could not speak the American language very well and neither could Shultz, so
they had a hard time getting acquainted, and about all Mrs. Grove found out was
that he lived about 3 miles (be­hind) town, but he did not say which town it
was. Mrs. Grove to this day doesnt know which town he meant. After a number of
arguments this man Shultz was convinced through comparing papers with Mr. Grove
that this was not his land, so he went on after plowing five acres. The <st1:City><st1:place>Groves</st1:place></st1:City>
never heard him again. Mrs. Groves chil­dren and grandchildren will always
remember the remarks and stories that she had to tell about the hu­morous
arguments (and misunder­standings) that she and her hus­band had with Mr.
Shuitz.</p>

attend­ed by the Groves in <st1:place>Dakota Terri­tory</st1:place> was the
one at her parents home, Sakarias Sigdestad. That new crude home had a
shingled roof but no windows or doors in as yet. This was on a Sunday, about
the middle of June of the same spring. The service was conducted by a young
student, whose summer work was to gather the new set­tlers together for
worship. They had no more services until the next fall when Rev. Storley of
Milbank came and held a meeting, with Holy Communion and Baptism at the Nels
Williamson home. It was on this occasion that Selma Grove, now Mrs. Rasmus Egge

the supply of flour they brought along from <st1:State><st1:place>Min­nesota</st1:place></st1:State>
was nearly gone. The near­est flour mill was the one at <st1:City><st1:place>Aber­deen</st1:place></st1:City>
and this meant that someone would have to make a trip there. John Grove and
Iver Skaare made this trip with a team of horses and a yoke of oxen and wagons,
each taking a load of wheat and trading it for flour. They also traded a 50 lb.
tub of butter made by Mrs. Grove for the very much needed food and clothing,
receiving 16 cents a pound for the butter. That first big purchase brought much
joy to the family.<o:p></o:p></p>

which is well known to all the old settlers. The Groves were for­tunate enough
to be at home when the storm struck as suddenly as a bolt of lightning. Mr.
Grove had just left for the poultry dug-out to feed the chickens and could
never have made his way back to the house without the loud calling of Mrs.
Grove. She wrapped a com­forter around her and followed the house wall not
daring to release her hand from the <span class=GramE>wall,</span> the storm
was so dark and blinding. They tried later in the day to get to the stable to
care for their stock, but it proved hopeless. Mrs. Grove held on to one end of
a long twine and stood by the corner of the house. Mr. Grove unwound the line
as he went along in search for the stable. When he reached the end of the line
there was no stable in sight, so he made his way back to the house by winding
the twine. It was in this storm that a Mr. Smutt liv­ing 2 miles west of
Groves at­tempted to go to the stable and got lost in the storm. His body was
found later about three quarters of a mile from the house on the farm where
Rasmus Egge now lives. <span class=GramE>He</span> ad made the attempt despite
the cautioning of his wife.</p>

Ear­ly one morning Mrs. Grove was startled when she saw two men come running up
to their place. Mr. Grove was out in the barn doing the chores. They were Joe
Sigdestad and Per Grodis; following them equally fast <span class=GramE>came</span>
Iver Skaare and Cornelius Verlo. They breathless­ly asked what the matter was.
Mr. and Mrs. Grove equally startled an­swered all was well. Then it dawn­ed
upon Joe Sigdestad that it was April fools day. Young Kolbin Mork, about 13
years old then, now living in Pierpont had aroused the neighborhood with a
sudden announcement that they must all rush over to Groves to help lift up an
old horse that had fal1en down.</p>

brought a priceless heritage with them from <st1:country-region><st1:place>Norway</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
The Bible, Forkiaring or Explanation and hymn book was made a part of their
daily life. The Iver Skaares and others had talked of organizing a
congregation even before the Grove family came. The interest and need increased
with children grow­ing up in every home. Services in their sod houses were
heartily wel­comed when ever a traveling minis­ter passed through. A pastor by
the name of Kjelaas helped organize the <st1:City><st1:place>Bergen</st1:place></st1:City>
congregation and also the Ladies Aid. The various homes and a school house
served as the meet­ing place for both organizations for many years or until
they managed to erect the first church. The wo­men gladly signed up as members
of the new Ladies Aid.</p>
