In boyhood, Charlie attended school at the Stoppel home and later in Bamber Valley.
 He cut wood, hauled it to Rochester, and sold it for fuel to Rochester businesses.
 At 18, he started out with a threshing outfit and threshed every fall until
he was 78 years old.  First he used a horse powered thresher, then steam, and
later various kinds of gasoline engines and tractors.

	Charlie met Sophia Agnes Regina Strobel and later married her on September 29,
1888.  She was born on March 10, 1867, in Ramson, Illinois.  She was baptized
on August 18, 1878, and confirmed October 18, 1878, in Dwight, Illinois, at Immanuel
Lutheran Church.  She came to Minnesota with her father, Freidrich (Fred) and
her stepmother in 1885.

	Sophia's father, Fred, was born on April 26, 1840, in Ligmaringen, Prussia.
 He was 14 years old when he came to the United States.  On September 8, 1861,
he enlisted into the Union Army, Company C 15th U.S. Infantry, in the Civil War
as a private.  At the close of his three-year enlistment, he re-enlisted, serving
the whole war.  He was twice wounded in the head and once in the leg.  At one
time, a New Testament, which he carried over his heart, saved his life because
it stopped a bullet.  He took part in engagements at Dogwalk, Stone Ridge, Gettysburg,
Shiloh, Siege of Corinth, Chicamauga, Missionary Ridge, Ringgold, Tunnel Hill,
and Sherman's march to the sea.  After his first wife (Sophia's mother), Christine
Kumpf (born in 1841 in Wessen Darstadt, Germany) died in 1876, at age 35, Fred
remarried to Albertine Machmann on October 24, 1876.  He worked as a blacksmith
and farmer after moving to Minnesota.  He died in Rochester on January 5, 1922,
at age 81.  Albertine died on April 17, 1948.

 He died on January 9, 1937.  One brother, Charles (born 1873) had died in 1875.

21, 1890), and Edna Strobel Ledder (born September 11, 1893).

	Charlie and Sophia lived on the farm land his father divided in 1893.  This
was 90 acres along Salem Road, known as the old Enke farm.  This was formerly
owned by Fred Enke and later sold to Michael Hohler from which Francis bought
the farm.  It had a stone house built in 1857 by Mr. Enke and a log barn and
sheds.  Charlie built the present barn in 1890 and the house in 1892.  The silo
was built in 1915.  In 1917, they were able to get electricity, and shared a
meter with Dr. Charles H. Mayo.  The garage was built in 1924.  In 1929, the
old stone house was torn down, and the stone was used in building the dam on
Dr. D. C. Balfour's farm on the Zumbro River.
