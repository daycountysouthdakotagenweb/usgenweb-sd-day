<BR>
&quot;HENRY STOPPEL, engaged in farming and stock-raising on section 8, Rochester
<BR>
township, Olmsted county, is a native of the State of Ohio, his birth
<BR>
occurring at Cincinnati in September, 1856 &lt;sic&gt;. He was a son of Frank
J. and
<BR>
Mary (Schwab) Stoppel, both of whom were natives of Germany. Early in life
<BR>
Frank J. Stoppel immigrated to America, and for a number of years engaged in
<BR>
farming near Cincinnati, Ohio.  In 1857 he brought his family to Olmsted
<BR>
county, Minnesota, took up a claim of 160 acres in Rochester township,
<BR>
cleared and cultivated same, and resided thereon until death halted his
<BR>
career in 1899.  His wife passed away in 1909. Both lie at rest in Oakwood
<BR>
Cemetery and their deaths were greatly mourned by their many friends
<BR>
throughout the county. To them seven children were born, six of whom are now
<BR>
living. Of these, Henry Stoppel now resides on and farms the old homestead.
<BR>
He was educated in the public schools of Rochester township, and since his
<BR>
schooling was completed has always followed farming. He devotes his time to
<BR>
the raising of grains and live stock and in dairying. His farm is well
<BR>
equipped with all modern conveniences, and aside from his holdings in
<BR>
Rochester township he owns 160 acres in Haverhill township, which he rents.
<BR>
In his political views Mr. Stoppel is a Democrat, and has served as school
<BR>
treasurer and supervisor of his township, holding the latter office for
<BR>
eleven consecutive years. His administration of township affairs has met
<BR>
with the approval of his fellowmen and he is influential in all public
<BR>
undertakings. In 1879 he was married to Mary Grimm, of Rochester township,
<BR>
and of German descent, and to them five children were born, named Clarence,
<BR>

<BR>
Church.&quot;
