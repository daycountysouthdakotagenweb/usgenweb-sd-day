	Someone asked that I write about the people, not just their birthdays, etc.
I could not do that about other members of this family about whom I know so little.
However, I am going to write this little bit about two that I did know well.
Perhaps others will add their stories to our history.

	I first met the Bernie Markham family in 1946 when Bill brought me to visit
them in their home on the farm in Section 10 of Oronoco Township. They lived
on a 170-acre farm; at that time, it was a real working farm. True, they didn't
have horses anymore, but they had them not long before. Bernie loved those horses,
and it nearly broke his heart to let them go. But farmers were finding tractors
were more efficient, and horses no longer earned their keep. Hard as it was,
Bernie had to sell his horses. I remember how lovingly he talked about his horses.
He showed me where he used to pasture them just east of the house, and he showed
me where he kept them in the barn. He talked about his horses and the equipment
he used with great joy and pride. He often told me stories about the horses he
had over the years. Bernie made a big hit with me. He was very kind to me. He
had a great sense of humor. He loved to tease me, but he also showed me lots
of respect. One thing I remember was how he built me a &quot;whatchamacallit&quot;
to step on when I went down into the basement which always seemed to have water
on the floor. By that time Bill, I, and Jeannine lived in their house on the
farm and Bernie and Mabel had retired and moved to a house in Oronoco. Another
time, Bernie came up to the farm and found me chopping down weeds in back of
the house. The weeds had got way out of hand and I was whapping away with a little
weed whacker when the handle broke in two. Bernie said he would take it home
and fix it. Well, he brought it back later, and he had put the cutter on the
end of a pipe. He told me that he had said to Mabel, &quot;that woman is trying
to chop down trees with this little thing.&quot; Bernie always took an interest
in the new house when we started building in 1968. He wasn't well enough anymore
to help with the work, but he came up and watched and delighted in the way things
were going. He liked to watch me tell the builders what I wanted. Bill was gone
so much in those days hauling milk and then milking cows before and after the
routes, that I was the straw boss on the building of the house. He helped a lot
with it whenever he could, but since I had dreamed about it the longest and planned
the most, he let me make most of the decisions. I guess that is only fair because
I was to spend the most time in the house. Anyway, I was sad that Bernie was
too ill to see us actually move into the house; he would have enjoyed that. We
moved in on March 19, 1969, after Bernie was in the nursing home. Bernie died
April 19, 1969. I had a dream after he died in which I saw Bernie coming across
the field on a big horse. As he came by me, he waved. He looked so happy. I believe
that he had to be in Heaven because he wouldn't be that happy otherwise. I am
glad because I hope to see him again some day.

	I also have wonderful memories of Mabel. She was a grand lady. She loved all
of us whether we were her own or married into the family. I was only 16 when
I met her and there were a few holes in my cooking education. Mabel taught me
much about cooking, raising a family, and many other skills; but the most important
thing she taught me was how to entertain. She had a get-together every holiday
and birthday and lots of times in between. She always welcomed each and every
member of the family, friends, and anyone else who came.  She made the best bread,
cakes, candy, doughnuts, cinnamon rolls, and cookies anyone ever tasted. I know
better than anyone what a great mother she was, because she raised one of the
greatest sons in the world. Other wives may disagree with me on that one, but
this is my story. Mabel lived 13 years after Bernie died.  She missed him terribly.
After she died, the minister told us &quot;she has gone to live in one of God's
mansions.&quot; I bet she is counting noses right now to see how many places
to set at the table. We will always remember her with love. Someday, when the
time is right, we will see her again.
