Letter written by Celestia A. Moore, age 40, to her parents Carolus and
Nancy Burch.  She mentions her husband John and her children Fred 17, Willie
14, Myron 8,and Winnie 3.  John and Celestia Moore had just moved in 1883
from their home in Michigan and homesteaded a claim on open land in the
Dakota Territory [now near Britton, South Dakota].

			Miller, Day Co. Dakota 	 Nov 8th, 1883

Dear Father & Mother,

	I will try to write to you again tonight.  We are as well
as usual.  John took some cold soding up the house.  The sod were so wet and
cold and he and Willie hurried for they thought it was going to freeze up,
but we are having a beautiful weather here now.  Fred and Willie have been
to the hills twice this week for wood and are going again in the morning.
The wood is mostly elm, but it burns well when it gets dry.
	Winnie sits by the table talking about Grandpa & Grandma.  She remembers
all about living there and riding on the horses and chasing the old gobbler.
She says Grandma gives Winnie and Myron fride cake and apples to eat and
Charley let her ride on Nelly.  
	We are putting a partition through the house and we will live in the south
end of it this winter.  There is a family north west of us that came from
Missouri.  They staid in Dakota last winter and they said they did not feel
the cold anymore than they did there when it was the coldest.  The wind does
not blow

								December 11th
	Well, after so long a time, I will try to finish my letter.  We have got
about 10 cords of wood all worked up and piled up back of the house besides
some chunks that they pound away at when they have the chance.  They will
have to go for 18 miles after it, if they get any more. The place where
George went with them is all cleared out.
	Five weeks ago, last Sunday, Aunt Mary fell out of the buggy and broke her
left arm above the elbow.  They were just starting to come down to Edwin's.
There is a Doctor from Detroit, Mich. lives on Section 20 in the town south
of us.  Fon[?] went and got him to come and set it.  It is doing nicely so
that she can take it out of the sling part of the time.
	We have had one cold spell. The thermometer was down to 10 below zero one
morning, 8 once, 2 once and zero twice, but it is warmer since and some
nights it doesn't freeze at all.  There was two mornings in October that the
ground was just white with snow but it melted off when the sun shone on it.
Last Friday, it snowed a little.  That is all gone now, but a few drifts.
	The station is to be 4 miles east and 1 1/2 south.  The Railroad Co. bought
80 acres, 20 off of each section 23-24-25-26.  The surveyor came last week
and surveyed the town and staked out the lots and the railroad buildings and
yard.  It is to the first division station with round house and shop_as[?]
is named Britton. But remember it isn't built yet, but every one thinks the
road will be laid through here next summer.  There is to be another road
about two miles west of us, an extension of the North Western from Columbia
to Waupaton[?].
	Next summer, I am going to save some of all the different kinds of grass.
I might have saved them this year if I had known that I should have a chance
to send them.
	Fred and Willie went up to Oscar Churches two weeks ago and got seed, wheat
and oats.  They were gone 4 days.  It must be nearly 45 miles.  The first
night they slept in a claim shanty.  They had hay with them and a thick
quilt and Edwin's Buffalo robe.  It was pretty cold and they took the oxen
in with them.  Stayed to Em's the next night.  Got there at noon and started
back home next morning.  That night they stayed at Black Stone and got home
about 4 the next afternoon.
	I haven't had but one cold since I have been here.  That was when George
was here.  It is getting late and I must close for I want to write some to
Abbie.  With love from all to all.

Letter from Celestia A. Moore to her sister, Abbie, in Michigan.


			Britton, Day Co, Dakota     Nov 21, 1884

Dear Sister and friends,

	I will try to write to you once more.  We have thrashed.  Had 234 bushels
of wheat and 162 of oats.  Willie has been to Andover once with wheat and
brought home coal.  Was gone a little over two days and a half.  He got 46
cts a bushel. It is 42 now, but we are in hopes it will come up some before
long.  Fred got home day before yesterday.  We have had beautiful fall
weather but it froze up Sunday and is snowing now for the first time.  25th
it was quite cold, down to 18 below zero, but is warmer now.  	Fred went to
Andover Tuesday morning with a load of wheat and got home last night a
little after midnight with another load of coal.  He bought 25 hundred.
John sent 20 bushel to Columbia mill by one of the neighbors and got 600 lbs
of flower for it and we thought it was a good trade for we had paid 3 to 4
dolars a hundred for all the flower we had bought since we came here.
	I dont think we shall have school much before spring.  The school house is
nearly done. It is a half mile north of here.  The children will only have a
half mile to go.
	John will send 10 dollars in this.  I was in hopes to have sent it all but
will have to wait.  It is getting late and I must stop.  Write soon.  Good bye.

Letter written by Celestia Moore, age 45, to her son Fred, who had moved
back to Michigan.



			Burch, Marshall Co, D.T.    Feb 26, 1888

Dear Fred,
	I dont wonder that you think I leave you to do all the writing but I am so
tired most of the time and the boys have been writing quite often.  We
havent sold any the stock.  It is to early yet to get what they are worth.
They are all looking well. Pa was going to drive Prince and Dick to town
last week with butter.  When they hitched them up, Prince threw himself
twice.  The last time he broke the tongue and they had to put him back in
the barn and take Dandy.  Got Edwin's sleigh and took the tongue down to
Franks and got it mended. The next day they took Dick and Prince again and
he started all right and went all right.
	A weasel got into the coop and killed 17 chickens and a turkey.  Ned shot
it.  It seems strange to have such warm weather and have it thaw as much in
the winter.  Edwin only comes home a little while on Sundays.  All the rest
of the time he is in the store.  Winnie hasnt been to school since it came
on cold.  Myron goes most of the time.  He has had two or three bad spells
of head ache.  Local option seems to work pretty will.  I havent heard of
any one trying to oppose it and I think it saved a great many lives during
the big blizzard.  I wish you could get the receipt of old Docks lineament
while you are there.
	Help Hattie all you can.  I hope Aunt Abbie will be better when you write
again.  Take good care of her and Grand Pa too.  I wish he was well enough
to come home with you and stay all summer.  Guy Lewis was here last evening.
They are all well.  He said he left Maw and Paw playing checkers.  Georgie
Law[?] and Clem are at Britton at school.  Law[?] has some wonderful
experiences at Church and School.  We heard that Jim Stokes and Bettie were
married but there was nothing of it in the paper.
	Mr. Pierce did intend to have another srte[?] with the Bund rocks but I
guess he has given it up.  I do hope Aunt Abbie will be better when this
gets there.  I commenced a letter to her long ago and will try to finish it.
				from mother,

Letter from Celestia Moore to her son, Fred.


			Burch, Marshall Co, D.T.  April 13, 1888
My Dear Fred,
	Your letter came last night.  We were glad to hear from you.  Ned took the
measles of Albert.  He has had them very bad.  They are beginning to go off
now, but he is sick in bed yet and I have to keep a mustard poultice on his
left lung all of the time and he coughs bad.  Myron and Winnie will come
down with them in about two days.  I hope they will have them lighter.
	The snow is all gone except around the stacks and stable, but the ground is
hardly fit to work, even Phons where it is so sandy.  The old man Tank
dragged a little on his hill but gave it up and went to drawing manure.
Annies husband works for him this summer.  Pa and Myron have got the seeder
together and are putting the drag together today.  The last time I was over
to Britton, Willie gave 4 dollars to finish paying Fenie and he told Pa
yesterday that he would hire a man for a month to help do the seeding for
Ned wont be able to do much in that time.  If he had not been sick, I think
he and Pa would have got along with it all right.  Myron thinks if he wont
have the measles to hard, he can finish that plowing with Dandy and Old
Bill.  They got 60 bushel of wheat of Rosmas to finish out the seed.
	Alva is mooving back to his place today so as to be ready for work.  Em has
been quite sick with the fever but is better now.  Pa saw Mr. Hubble in town
and wanted to know your address.  Did he write and send you pay.
	We shall be glad to get the taxes of you for we shall have to hire it and
you know what sharks they are here.  I wish that you were here to help do
the seeding for we might as pay you as any one and we should know ____ was
done good.  Mr. McCoy has sent in Pas papers for a pension.  If he gets it
he is to have 25 dollars, if not he has nothing.
	We have had one hard rain the only one since Will and George were here.  I
shall have to stop writing to get the dinner.  I will send that note in this
if you will send the money as soon as you can would like it for I suppose
there is a percentage on them all of the time now.  You had better send it
to Britton.  Give my love to all the folks.  I will try to write to them
soon.  From you mother,
						Celestia A. Moore
