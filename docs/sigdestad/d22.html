 was born on 15 Feb 1938 in St. Paul, MN.  He was baptized on 17 Apr 1940 in
St. Paul, MN.  He was adopted on 23 Oct 1954 in Clay County, MN.  On 14 Feb 1947
care and custody was awarded to the Lutheran Welfare Society by the Juvenile
Court of Ransey County, Minnesota.  He served in the military between 1957 and
1959 in Naval Hospital, Philadelphia, PA.  He graduated in May 1957 in Ork Grove
Luth., Fargo, N.D..  He graduated in May 1963 in Concordia College, Moorhead,
MN.  He graduated in 1965 in NDSU, Frago, ND.  He graduated in 1968 in Ph.D.,
University of Iowa.  Curtis graduated from Oak Grove Lutheran High School, Fargo,
N.D. in 1957.  He then entered active duty with the USN where he graduated from
Hospital Corps School, at the San Diego Naval Hospital.  He was then transferred
to the Naval Hospital Philadelphia, PA where he worked, for the most part, in
the ear, nose &amp; throat operating room.  He was discharged in August 1959
and enrolled at Concordia College, Moorhead, MN and graduated with a BA degree,
majoring in Zoology and Chemistry.  He graduated in 1963.  He then attended NDSU,
Fargo and received a MS degree in Radiological Health Physics in 1965.  That
same year he was accepted in a doctoral program in Radiation Biology at the Univesity
of Iowa, Iowa City, IA.  He received his  Ph.D. degree in the Fall of 1968. 
He then did a 2 year post-doctoral fellowship at Alleghany General Hospital,
Pittsburgh, PA in Cancer Biology and Radiation Effects.  In 1970 he accepted
his first job as Assistant Professor of Radiology at the University of Louisville
School of Medicine.  He had Social Security Number 470-38-7856.  He was a Professor
in University of Louisville, Louisville, KY.  Appointed Assistand Professor of
Radiology on 1 May 1970,  Promoted to Associate Professor in 1973.  Promotion
to Full Professor in 1980  Thoughts of Daniel J. Sigdestad, 1982
<BR>

<BR>
          It was extremely difficult to continue our usual way of life without
the thought of having
<BR>
Buddy with us.  We tried to cope with the loss in a realistic way, but the memories
could not be
<BR>
erased.  Time may dim them but they are not eradicated.
<BR>
          In the course of the year that followed, the thought of adopting a
boy constantly entered
<BR>
our minds to the point that we could not erase it.  After long, thoughtful delibera-tions
we
<BR>
contacted the Lutheran Welire Society in St. Paul about adoption procedures.
 They were glad to
<BR>
oblige and contacts were readily established.
<BR>
          By now our deliberations became anxious anticipations of what was to
become a life-long
<BR>
relationship far beyond our meager expectations.  We drove to St. Paul to contact
the case worker
<BR>
who, after a friendly business visit, asked us to follow her into the room where
the children were
<BR>
gathered.  Unobtrusively we entered the room and watched the children at play
without their
<BR>
being aware of our reason for being there, other than the case worker was showing
us around. 
<BR>
     Little did Curtis realize that we had selected him as the one we would be
happy and anxious
<BR>
to adopt into our family.  While we mingled amongstthe group talking, first to
this one, then to
<BR>
that one, the case worker asked Curtis to come over to her.  He came at once.
 she handed him a
<BR>
book and asked me to help him read it.  Willingly, without hesitation he came,
sat on my lap as
<BR>
we began by looking at the pictures.  It was notlong before I had his entire
attention.  That did
<BR>
it--I was thoroughly convinced that we had selected the right one.  That was
the begining of the
<BR>
adoption process.
<BR>
          From time to time the caseworker made periodic visits to our home,
studying us as
<BR>
adoptive parents, familiarizing herself with our life-style, our character, our
integrity as well as
<BR>
our ability to provide a good home.  Time went on; more visits to our home, why
so many we did
<BR>
not know, but the day came, however, when the adoption procedure could be consummated,
and
<BR>
for us it could not come too soon because it had already been a long routine.
 Eventually the
<BR>
adoption was finalized.  On October 23rd, 1954 he became ours. 
<BR>
          On the way home from St. Paul, Curtis found the road to be endlessly
long.  &quot;How many
<BR>
miles do we have left?&quot; and &quot;Are we soon in Moorhead? He was asked
more than once.  He
<BR>
fought sleep but finally gave up when we were an hour from home.  When we woke
him from his
<BR>
sleep, he wasted no time surveying his new surroundings.  This was his home enceforth.
<BR>
          On our way to Sunday school that first Sunday Freda said it was so
nice to see Curtis and
<BR>
me walking together as we left the house.  She sensed the pride that was ours
to once again have
<BR>
a son who filled that hither to void that had plagued us.  Curtis filled that
beautifully.  We were
<BR>
mighty proud as parents too, for in him we found added joy and comradeship. 
His magnetic
<BR>
personality, friendliness and happy disposition won him friends, both young and
old.
<BR>
          After grade school, he attended and graduated from Oak Grove Lutheran
High School
<BR>
where he was active in athletics.  He was also active in the Naval Reserves and
as such would be
<BR>
required to have two years of active training at a naval base.  After two years
at the San Diego
<BR>
Naval Training Center he enrolled at Concordia College where he received a Bachelor
of Science
<BR>
degree in Biology.  The following fall, with the aid of a grant, he enrolled
at the North Dakota
<BR>
State University where he continued his studies in science for a year and received
his Masters
<BR>
Degree.  By now he had gotten a grant to continue his studies, this time at the
University of Iowa
<BR>
in Iowa City where he was awarded his Ph.D. in Radiation Biology.  Upon completion
of his
<BR>
studies he served two years in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania before going to Louisville,
Kentucky
<BR>
where he continues his Cancer Research work.
<BR>
          We are humbly grateful for his achievements, his loyalty to us and
to his work.  Little did
<BR>
we realize what happiness and satisfaction was awaiting us as we ventured on
that journey
<BR>
together.
<BR>
          I have been singularly blessed.  If I feel that what God has taken
from me is indispensable,
<BR>
I must be cognizant of the fact that He never takes more than He gives in return.

Johnson SIGDESTAD</B> <A HREF="djs2.jpg">(photo)</A> was born on 17 Sep 1899
in Bristol, S.D..  
<BR>

<BR>
     The golden morning sun rose radiantly over the hills and valleys on the
South Dakota
<BR>
prairie that beautiful autumn day when mother's anxious moment culminated in
my arrival into
<BR>
this world.
<BR>
     Mother had previously lost a pair of twins which left her grief-stricken
and sad.  With
<BR>
implicit faith in her Lord and an abiding trust in His promises, she prayed in
her distress that God
<BR>
would entrust her with another pair of twins.  I am here as a result of her ardent
and impassioned
<BR>
prayers.
<BR>
     Selmer and I were born at home on Sunday September 17, 1899.  These births
healed the
<BR>
fallen, yet indomitable spirit of mother whose trusting faith and fidelity could
not be shaken or
<BR>
dimmed.  How fortunate to be born into a family whose lives were centered around
and
<BR>
motivated by their loving Savior.
<BR>
     My earliest recollection of home was my inability to enter the shanty adjacent
to the
<BR>
house under construction because I could not operate the latch-string on the
door.
<BR>
          I well remember how mother took pains in dressing us, partly so as
to confound the
<BR>
relatives in identifying us. For her own way of telling us apart she tied a red
hankerchief around
<BR>
the neck of one of us.  Could it be that the one so designated would unfasten
the tie, thereby
<BR>
confusing mother?  Not likely!  We were too young for such pranks, possibly only
two or three
<BR>
years old.
<BR>
          Carefree summers soon came to an abrupt end when we were old enough
to go to school. 
<BR>
My first day in school will always linger in my mind.  Dad brought us to school
in a buggy
<BR>
drawn by King and Prince.  As Dad left the school grounds I cried uncontrollably.
 Not even the
<BR>
loving, assuring voice of a concerned teacher could control my lonesome, homesick
feeling. 
<BR>
Peering through the west window of the schoolroom I watched Dad returning to
our clearly
<BR>
visible home until I lost sight of him as he turned off the road towards the
barn. The first
<BR>
day of school seemed endless, but it came and went.  The distance home that first
day was
<BR>
joyfully shortened by the thrill of going home where I felt more secure.  Our
shortcut route to the
<BR>
schoolhouse was a clearly defined path across Anton Norby's and Uncle Sakris's
fields rather
<BR>
than walking the main road.  Selmer would invariably take the lead.  Over the
stubble fields he
<BR>
would aim the course so straight that we marveled at his ability to do so at
such an early age. 
<BR>
This same course was repeated each year through-out our eight years of rural
school training.
<BR>
This path was visible for a long distance until it was plowed under in late fall
when a new and
<BR>
more difficult path had to be made over the plowed ground. 
<BR>
     For boys growing up on the farm the most difficult part of starting school
again after
<BR>
having gone bare-foot during summer may have been the wearing of shoes which
the calloused
<BR>
and unfettered feet protested.
<BR>
          Clothing was drab for the most part for school children.  Girls wore
their hair in braids tied
<BR>
with large bows or worn with a band.  The boys' hair was usually trimmed with
shears.  To get
<BR>
the edges somewhat even a large bowl was placed on the head so the shears followed
the contour
<BR>
of the bowl.
<BR>
          My first grade teacher, Carrie Vale, was one who went beyond her call
of duty.  Individual
<BR>
help was never denied any pupil in spite of a full daily schedule in an overcrowded
one-room
<BR>
school.
<BR>
          When we grew older we helped our parents with their daily chores. 
Even as preschoolers
<BR>
Selmer and I would offer to milk a certain tame cow although mother frowned on
that offer
<BR>
because of the danger involved.  We were confident we could trust our pet cow,
so with pail in
<BR>
one hand and stool in the other we sat down to prove our offer, Selmer on one
side and I on the
<BR>
other.  We did it, but mother thought we worked too fast, so she tested our feeble
attempt to see
<BR>
if we had gotten that last drop of milk.  We were taught at an early age that
whatever was worth
<BR>
doing was worth doing well, so the next time we offered to help, we tried to
perform to mother's
<BR>
liking.  A few years later, however, we could never figure out why we were so
anxious to learn
<BR>
the art of milking.  When we didn't have to do it,  it was fun; but when that
became our daily
<BR>
chore it was far less appealing.
<BR>
          Another chore after school was helping mother by going to the pasture
to pick cow chips. 
<BR>
We would take partially dried chips, stack them in pairs in an upright position
for further drying. 
<BR>
In a day or two, depending upon the need, we would take gunny sacks, gather the
dried chips and
<BR>
carry the sacks home on our shoulders.
<BR>
          Water was heated in a pan or kettle atop a coal-burning stove.  The
large oven turned out
<BR>
golden loaves of relished bread.  The inviting aroma in the kitchen on such days
was impelling
<BR>
enough to make us want to help mother feed the stove, knowing we could sample
the bread, hot
<BR>
from the oven.
<BR>
          We always had enough to eat, though I am sure it taxed Mother's ingenuity
to plan meals
<BR>
on a small budget. Bread we had always, potatoes and other vegetables from the
garden were
<BR>
abundant.  Beef and pork raised on the farm rounded out the meals with an occasional
duck or
<BR>
jackrabbit. We learned at an early age not to waste food.  We were often chided
if an uneaten
<BR>
portion of food was left on or behind the plate.  Often crusts of bread were
left hidden behind the
<BR>
plate, unseen by the offender but clearly visible to the scrutinizing eyes of
Mother and Dad. 
<BR>
They made sure that it was eaten before we could have our dessert.  The cookie
jar was always a
<BR>
temptation.  We were never denied any food, but between meals we were taught
to ask for it.
<BR>
     A wash stand and a cistern pump occupied a corner of the large kitchen.
 Therewas also a
<BR>
pail for water and a dipper.  Jackets, caps and coats were hung on a row ofhooks
behind the
<BR>
kitchen door.  Under the watchful eye of mother these hooks were usedas expected.
 Clothes
<BR>
draped over a convenient chair or dropped on the floor or carelesslytossed in
a corner were
<BR>
quickly identified with its proper owner.  Overshoes were lined upneatly near
the door on a piece
<BR>
of paper to protect the floor.  Mud or snow was often trackedin nonetheless,
and Mother did a lot
<BR>
of mopping up on her linoleum-covered floor.
<BR>
          On wash days a goodly part of the kitchen became a laundry room.  A
wash tubplaced on a
<BR>
bench and a copper boiler were brought in from their storage place.  Water washeated
in the
<BR>
boiler on the kitchen range.  All clothes were rubbed and scrubbed by handon
a washboard. 
<BR>
Clothes were hung outside to dry.  In winter the clothes would freeze stiffon
the line.  The
<BR>
long-handled underwear ranging down-ward in size from Dad's 40 to Joel's diminutive
<BR>
proportion assumed grotesque shapes.  Improper handling in this frozen condition
could damage
<BR>
the fabric, so they were carried in carefully like headless ghosts.  A few minutes
in the warm
<BR>
kitchen would collapse them enough so they could be draped over chairs to complete
drying.  It
<BR>
was little wonder that Mother's hands remained red, swollen and sore.  The rite
of the Saturday
<BR>
night bath was likewise performed in the kitchen.  Again the water was heated
in the kitchen. 
<BR>
One at a time we stepped into the wash tub.  All wastewater was carried outside
to be dumped. 
<BR>
This was usually done by the one next in line unless Dad was close by.
<BR>
     After supper the table was cleared so we could use it as a desk on which
to do our
<BR>
homework.  Many were the arithmetic problems with which I struggled!
<BR>
     A large hard-coal heater took up considerable space in the living room.
 We never tired
<BR>
of admiring the distorted images of our faces reflected in the highly polished
nickel-plated
<BR>
trimmings.  The smoothly rounded surfaces were wonderful against which to warm
our cold
<BR>
hands and feet.  In wintertime we both dressed and undressed within the circle
of that pleasant
<BR>
warmth.  The cheerful glow of fire within shone through the isinglass doors that,
when viewed
<BR>
from the outdoors, caused us to rush through our chores so we could get back
into the house to
<BR>
enjoy the comfort of that inviting glow.
<BR>
          A stairway off the kitchen led to the bedrooms upstairs. These rooms
were suffocatingly
<BR>
hot in summer and frigid in winter.  A heavy patchwork quilt over woolen blankets
covered each
<BR>
bed.  In extreme wintry weather layers of news-paper were placed between the
blankets for added
<BR>
warmth. Bedbugs, often found in egg crates exchanged when eggs were hauled to
town,
<BR>
abounded in spite of mother's unending war against them.  Men who often worked
in logging
<BR>
camps in winter would bring with them these infectious creatures, thereby multiplying
and
<BR>
augmenting the already heavy load of our distraught mother.  She would spray
kerosene behind
<BR>
the moldings, into the cracks, over the frame and springs and even into the corners
of the
<BR>
mattresses.
<BR>
     Mother's life with Dad was generally tranquil.  Dad worked hard to provide
for us in so
<BR>
many ways.  Childhood diseases in the early 1900's added to the parent's worries.
Most children
<BR>
caught and survived chicken pox, measles, mumps whooping cough and scarlet fever.
 We
<BR>
always strove for perfect attendance in school, but when I was in fifth grade
I contracted mumps
<BR>
which forced me to stay home for a week--there went my attendance record!  Clara
was the only
<BR>
one of us that had a perfect record throughout her eight years of school for
which she was
<BR>
recognized at graduation time.
<BR>
	Travel during the early years was at best very crude and slow.  Roads were only
trails and
<BR>
money for road building was scarce.  I can recall the time when a team of horses
pulling a
<BR>
hand-controlled scraper was used to fill in low places, thus making a grade over
watered areas. 
<BR>
Culverts were made of wood to be placed in low areas, then covered with dirt
for drainage
<BR>
purposes.  Of course oxen supplied the earliest power used for transportation.
 They were often
<BR>
hitched with horses for added power.  Later horses replaced the oxen, speeding
up the work.  The
<BR>
buggy replaced the wagon, thus reducing the time it took to go places. 
<BR>
     Exchange work with the neighbors was common.  During winter months sleighs
were
<BR>
used; also a light rig known as a cutter.  Before the automobile came into being
we had a shiny
<BR>
new buggy with a collapsible top, equipped with side curtains for use in bad
weather or as
<BR>
protection from the sun.  A new buggy and a frisky horse was the desire of those
who could
<BR>
afford it and the envy of those less fortunate.
<BR>
     Our first automobile was a 1917 Reo with a collapsible top and side curtains.
 It was a
<BR>
sturdy, rugged four-cylinder model that, when forced, could attain to a speed
of 35 miles an hour. 
<BR>
When it came to muddy roads it could plow its way through with little difficulty.
 During the
<BR>
winter months the car was jacked  up to save the tires, and the battery placed
in the cellar to keep
<BR>
it from freezing.
<BR>
     Life before the turn of the century was very simple. There was no electricity,
no
<BR>
telephones and no running water. A clearly defined path led to the outhouses
where the
<BR>
Montgomery Ward and Sears Roebuck catalogues served their final purpose.   
<BR>
     Whatever we had was a result of what we ourselves created.  We made our
sleds, and
<BR>
made skis from old discarded door tracks or staves from large barrels.  Harnesses
made from
<BR>
twine were used when we hitched trained calves to pull us around in our little
wagon.
<BR>
     To get water for the livestock a well had to be dug by hand.  That required
an enormous
<BR>
amount of work.  Usually the well was dug with a tiling spade.  The dirt was
hoisted up in
<BR>
buckets which, when moist, would be difficult to empty.  Imagine digging a well
by hand four
<BR>
feet in diameter and fifteen to twenty feet deep!
<BR>
      The early pioneers did not have much money with which to buy coal, so wood
had to be cut
<BR>
for that purpose.  That was always a good winter's job.
<BR>
      Field work was far different from the present, modern methods.  Tractors
were unheard of. 
<BR>
The machinery was crude. The walking plow, the walking cultivator, the miniature
reaper that
<BR>
left the grain untied were the common machines in use.  Years later the riding
machinery became
<BR>
better known.  Shocking grain was a detestable job, especially barley, as the
beards would lodge
<BR>
in your shirt and socks causing unending itching.
<BR>
      Since threshing machines were few we had to take our turn in getting our
grain into the bins. 
<BR>
This would be late in the fall.  It was not unusual to be threshing after the
first snowfall.  In order
<BR>
to get the fall plowing done the grain had to be stacked in huge cone-shaped
stacks, usually four
<BR>
to six stacks to a setting, then the plowing could be done with ease.
<BR>
      Threshing every fall was fascinating to us.  To see that enormous steam
engine puffing black
<BR>
clouds of smoke was terrifying.  That smooth flowing power operated the separator
with such
<BR>
ease that the straw came bellowing out of the blower in massive heaps to form
a huge straw pile
<BR>
in which we loved to frolic-after the machine moved away.  The shrill whistle
from the engine
<BR>
would penetrate our ears with deafening force.
<BR>
     When we heard Dad mention the approximate time the threshers would come
to our farm,
<BR>
we would gaze through the schoolroom windows in eager anticipation of its arrival.
When that
<BR>
time came we lost all interest in our school work. The teacher knew why we were
so restless, but
<BR>
as long as we did not misbehave we were not scolded.  Our only concern was to
rush home so we
<BR>
could ride the grain wagon with Dad to the field where the machine was in operation.
 What a
<BR>
thrill! For several years we were fortunate in having the threshers at our place
on our birthday. 
<BR>
One such fall day stands out very vividly in my mind:  Selmer and I had gotten
pocket knives
<BR>
with a chain to fasten them to our overall button for safety.  I can't recall
any birthday present
<BR>
that was more appreciated than that knife.  To show our pride in that unexpected
gift, we were
<BR>
anxious to follow Dad to the threshing crew so we could show off our treasured
birthday present. 
<BR>
Dad sensed our joy and understood our pride. 
<BR>
     A greater attraction than the threshing machine was the cook-car.  The inviting
aroma
<BR>
surrounding the area was a beckoning call for us to survey the premises, I would
dare Selmer; he
<BR>
would dare me to go close enough so that cooks would be aware that we were neared
I would
<BR>
steal Close to the steps at the entrance, listening closely to find out in which
end of the cook-car
<BR>
the ladies might be working.  When I thought they were in the opposite end, unmindful
of us, I
<BR>
would peek in the doorway to explore what was going on.  As sure as I did I was
caught by an
<BR>
unexpected gaze that jerked my head back in a jolting manner.  When the cooks
sensed our
<BR>
sneaky intrusion they knew why we were there.  It wasn't long before they satisfied
our curiosity
<BR>
by giving us a cookie or a doughnut.  Then we were happy and satisfied.
<BR>
     Dad was a man of sterling character.  He never imbibed in alcoholic beverages
and never
<BR>
used any form of tobacco. He practiced what he preached, setting an example worthy
to follow. 
<BR>
He was always regular in attending church as was mother, and they expected the
same of the
<BR>
children.
<BR>
          Mother and Dad read by the light of the kerosene lamp with a reflector
attached to it.  The
<BR>
reading material included the Bible which was used daily, Decorah Posten (news)
and
<BR>
Minneapolis Tidende, and the Dakota Farmer.  With Decorah Posten came Vedarnen,
which was
<BR>
a tabloid that was more often read by neighbors because the exhilarating and
hilarious (funnies)
<BR>
called &quot;Ola and Per&quot; became a frequent topic of conversation.  That
was a scream!
<BR>
          The kerosene lamp was replaced by the Aladdin lamp which was a tremendous
<BR>
improvement.  Now we could see clearly from any area of the large kitchen instead
of rushing
<BR>
to get to the limited spot illumined by the small lamp's reflector.
<BR>
          In 1918 Dad had electric lights installed in all the buildings.  What
an extravagance!  Not
<BR>
so.  We had experienced some good years and Dad thought it would be a good investment,
and
<BR>
that is what it turned out to be.  No longer was it necessary to clean lamp and
lantern chimneys, a
<BR>
job which we disliked.  All that was necessary now was to press the button. 
What a welcome
<BR>
change!  A large Genco generating plant furnished the power by storing it in
16 large glass
<BR>
batteries.  No more danger of fire in the barn that held 70 tons of hay; no more
danger of a cow
<BR>
&quot;jumping over the moon&quot; because the lantern capsized.  By now we were
comfortably situated so
<BR>
we could enjoy the comforts of the day.
<BR>
     Dark gloomy clouds of the first world war had hung on the horizon since
1914.  The
<BR>
United States was not involved until later.  In 1917-18 men were being drafted
and ordered to
<BR>
military training camps.  Meanwhile people at home were busy making articles
of clothing
<BR>
needed by the soldiers. The Bergen Charity Circle, of which we were members,
met regularly for
<BR>
this purpose, and that was the time Mother taught me to knit. 
<BR>
     The summer of 1918 caught Selmer and me in the army draft.  This was of
great concern
<BR>
to the folks, fearing we would be called for military training.  We registered
as soon as we were
<BR>
18 years old which was three months before Armistice Day.  We were classified
I-A which
<BR>
meant that we were physically fit for army training, and that we would be next
in line to be called
<BR>
for camp duty.  The thought of our leaving home was not very pleasant for Mother
and Dad, but
<BR>
their anxiety was soon alleviated when, within a matter of a few weeks, the Armistice,
ending the
<BR>
war, was signed on November 11, 1918.
<BR>
          Since there was no refrigeration in the early part of the century,
meat had to be cured to
<BR>
keep it from spoiling. Dad built a smokehouse for this purpose, using a 55 gallon
oil drum.  The
<BR>
top of the drum was removed to allow the smoke to escape and penetrate the meat
that was hung
<BR>
on the surrounding walls.  Again we had fun challenging each other, this time
to see who could
<BR>
stay the longest in the smoke-filled house.  I don't know who won, but I know
I came out
<BR>
choking and with eyes and nose running.  A slow-burning fire without flame cured
the meat to a
<BR>
delectable taste.
<BR>
          Before hams could be smoked they were soaked in a brine solution in
a large earthen crock
<BR>
for several days.  In this solution they would keep for weeks. 
<BR>
     Dried beef was another variety of home-prepared meat. This had to be salted
for a given
<BR>
time, then hung to dry. When ready, Dad wrapped it in cloth, put it in a sack
and buried it in the
<BR>
grain bin.  Mutton prepared this way became &quot;spekekjot,&quot; a favorite
amongst Norwegians.
<BR>
          The large dried cod fish Dad bought occasionally had to be prepared
in a special way
<BR>
before it could be cooked. Mother would put the cod in a large earthen crock
filled with a salt
<BR>
and water mixture to which some lye had been added.  Before this &quot;Lutefisk&quot;
was cooked, it was
<BR>
washed and again soaked in water.  Served with melted butter, mashed or boiled
potatoes, it was
<BR>
a most delectable meal. Lefse was always a companion.
<BR>
          It was necessary to work if one wanted spending money. During the warm
days of
<BR>
summer, Sam, Joe and I trapped gophers.  The county paid a two-cent bounty for
tails.
<BR>
stuffedinto our overall pockets several slices of dried beef, and with our traps
in hand took off to
<BR>
the pasture. There we spent the entire day trapping and relishing our dried beef
dinner.
<BR>
          To keep the gopher tails intact we placed them in a snuff box discarded
by our hired man. 
<BR>
On Saturdays we would go with Dad to town and trade our &quot;loot&quot; for
celluloid rings which we
<BR>
used for trimming the harnesses.
<BR>
          This became our weekly event in the summer, so much so that whenever
the Knott boys
<BR>
saw us coming into the hardware store they would jokingly say: &quot;Here come
those pesky ring
<BR>
buyers.&quot;  That didn't bother us.  We were happy with our purchases, and
next week we would go
<BR>
back for more.
<BR>
          The folks believed in giving us a good education that they were denied.
 Parochial school
<BR>
was attended for a month following secular school.  Here memory work was paramount.
The
<BR>
&quot;Catechism,&quot; the &quot;Forklaring&quot; (explanation) and &quot;Bible
History&quot; were memorized verbatim.  The
<BR>
last period in the afternoon consisted of writing from dictation several para-graphs
dictated by
<BR>
the teacher from the &quot;lesebok&quot; (Reader). This required intense study
because we were responsible
<BR>
for spelling and paragraphing, as well as diacritical markings.
<BR>
          Our noon recess was usually spent playing ball or crickets, but if
we saw a gopher running
<BR>
in the school yard, we formed a water brigade, carried water from Uncle Sakris'
nearby slough,
<BR>
poured it into the hole and waited for the gopher to come out.  Then with a stick
or rock in our
<BR>
hands we would attack, many times too early or too late.  That was discouraging,
so next time we
<BR>
used a snare made out of twine.  That was more effective.           Our teacher's
motto
<BR>
was&quot;obedience.&quot;  We were expected to follow her rules to the letter.
 If we got out of hand once
<BR>
there would not be a second time.  Mother too expected wholehearted support.
 If I had been
<BR>
reprimanded for some offense, the folks would surely find out, than I would get
another censure
<BR>
when I got home.
<BR>
          That brings to mind another incident when Selmer and I had been given
permission to go
<BR>
to Jake Fosheim's place to play with Jake and Art.  They were the only boys in
the neighborhood
<BR>
that had a bicycle.  That intrigued us and was the main reason we wanted to be
with them. 
<BR>
Mother told us to be home at a certain time and she meant it.  That evening Selmer
went at the
<BR>
precise time, but I was having too much fun with the bike to heed mother's order.
 Later I wished
<BR>
I had, for when I got home mother applied something to that part of my anatomy
that touches the
<BR>
chair when I sit down.  That taught me to respect her orders. 
<BR>
     Sunday dinners were always special but usually late, not due to Mother's
negligence, but
<BR>
rather because of the long-winded sermons by the preacher.  It was not uncommon
to delay the
<BR>
dinner until one O'clock though the services began precisely at eleven o'clock.
 If baptism,
<BR>
communion or confirmation were a part of the service, the dinner was further
delayed.  To us as
<BR>
youngsters it often reached the point when we thought more about mother's good
dinner awaiting
<BR>
us than of what transpired in church.  There was scarcely a Sunday that we did
not have company
<BR>
for dinner. That was the price the folks paid for living so close to the church--only
80 rods away. 
<BR>
We always enjoyed company, then mother might have a little something extra, but
it just meant
<BR>
that rambunctious boys, eager to go out to play, had to wait till the grown-ups
had been served. 
<BR>
That was usually a very tedious wait.
<BR>
     Mother's generous heart never permitted anyone to go hungry.  Meat,  vegetables,butter
<BR>
and eggs of which we had plenty, were given to the Pastor for the family's use.
 At Thanksgiving
<BR>
time mother always had a large turkey ready for the parsonage together with freshly
baked bread,
<BR>
cookies and pies.
<BR>
          Preparation for Christmas always started the first week in December.
 School children
<BR>
from the various districts gathered at Bergen church on the first Saturday to
be assigned their
<BR>
particular part in the program which con-sisted of poems, dialogues, songs and
pantomimes, all
<BR>
to be memorized. When thus assigned we studied diligently for the next Saturday's
practice.  The
<BR>
night assigned for the &quot;Juletrefest&quot; (Christmas Tree Festival) was
the highlight of all the winter
<BR>
activities.  No one stayed home that night. Grandmas as well as new-born babes
were there. 
<BR>
Soon there was only standing room left.  When the program was over the children
marched
<BR>
around the altar where each one was given a bag of candy and nuts; to our joy
a nice red apple
<BR>
was added when we got back to our assigned seats.
<BR>
          Celebrating Christmas for at least two weeks required much time and
planning.  Mother
<BR>
went all out to make it a joyous occasion for all of us.  Christmas Eve dinner
was extra special. 
<BR>
There was never a time we did not have a brand new oil cloth to deck the kitchen
table although
<BR>
the present one would have served the purpose as well.  That special meal consisted
of lutefisk,
<BR>
mashed potatoes with delicious brown gravy, spare-ribs, lefse, flatbread, fattigman,
kringla,
<BR>
pickles, and all kinds of cookies and cake.  When supper was over the  Christmas
Story was read
<BR>
3 followed with an evening prayer.  At an early age we were taught the true meaning
of
<BR>
Christmas.
<BR>
          For several days following, the neighbors invited the young folks for
a fun time which
<BR>
would be spent in singing, playing parlor games, and, of course, eating a delightful
lunch.  This
<BR>
would go on far into the night.  We did our chore early so we could leave home
right after
<BR>
supper, thus making the evening's fun last longer.  After two weeks of such exciting
socializing,
<BR>
we were satisfied to get back to our regular routine.
<BR>
          Mother and Dad made their home on the farm until 1926 when they purchased
a house and
<BR>
retired to Bristol.  Selmer, who had worked the farm for a few years, purchased
the land and
<BR>
continued its operation.
<BR>
          There were nine children in our family.  Minnie was the first to survive
after the death of
<BR>
the first four infants which included a pair of twins.  Minnie was born November
11, 1897,
<BR>
Selmer and I on September 17, 1899, Joel on May 17, 1902, and Clara on July 29,
1905.          
<BR>
After a year's bout with pernicious anemia, Mother passed away on September 14,
1936 at the
<BR>
age of 72b years. After Mother's passing Dad made his home on the farm with Selmer
and Elsie. 
<BR>
He enjoyed being on the farm, staying there for several years before moving to
Moorhead,
<BR>
Minnesota where he spent his remaining days with Joel and Clarice. He passed
away on January 23, 1950 at 85 years of age.   Blessed be their memory.

 He died on 18 Jul 1946 in Moorhead, MN.  
<BR>

<BR>
     The first child born to us was Duane Wesley who got his second name from
his Mother's
<BR>
maiden name.  Duane was born at the Peabody Hospital in Webster, South Dakota,
on March 8,
<BR>
1925.  I was teaching the home school at the time. When the news came to me I
rushed to the
<BR>
hospital immediately after school to see our first-born,a bouncing 8 pound 12
ounce baby boy. 
<BR>
What a thrill!  what a joy!  What a welcome member to the family.  He was a delight
to care for,
<BR>
a privilege to instruct and an honor to have as our own.
<BR>

<BR>
    His early schooling was done in several different places because of my various
teaching
<BR>
positions.  He finished his grade school in the Webster school system.  He was
confirmed in St.
<BR>
John's Lutheran church in 1940 by Rev. Johan Kildahl.  In the fall of 1941 we
moved to
<BR>
Moorhead, Minnesota where he began his high school training.  During his junior
year he was
<BR>
drafted into the army. He joined the paratroop division and trained in Fort Bragg,
North Carolina
<BR>
before going overseas.  He served as a motor-cycle patrolman in Marsailles, France
for six
<BR>
months before going to Germany.  It was in one of the major battles (Battle of
the Bulge) that he
<BR>
landed in an isolated area, away from his comrades, and when he was found by
members of his
<BR>
battalion his feet were frozen, almost to the point of amputation.  He was evacuated
to a hospital
<BR>
in London where he recuperated until he was released three days before V-Day.
 On March 14,
<BR>
1946 he was discharged from the service, arriving home from Camp McCoy, Wisconsin
the same
<BR>
day.  The anticipation, the joy of having him home safely was not to be enjoyed
very long.  On
<BR>
the 18th day of July he met sudden death in a tragic motorcycle accident on his
way home from
<BR>
Wahpeton, North Dakota where he had gone with some friends to get repairs for
a cycle that
<BR>
belonged to one of them. He was buried in Riverside Cemetery in Moorhead on July
22, 1946
<BR>
following services in Trinity church conducted by Rev. Roy Harrisville.
<BR>
          Why he was taken we cannot answer.  It is all in Divine hands.  I like
to think when the
<BR>
young are called, that perhaps they are favored--perhaps they are called to add
a spot of beauty--a needed flower in the Heavenly gardens--a blossom that will
grow in a greater beauty there.

on 24 Jun 1881 from Bergen Norway.  He died on 23 Jan 1950 in Moorhead, MN. 
Thoughts of John S. Sigdestad, by his son Daniel
<BR>

<BR>
          Father's only day of rest was on Sunday.  His all-occasion blue serge
suit served him so long that the seat of his pants shone like a mirror.  He was
&quot;klokker&quot; (sexton) for many years in Bergen church until the English
language replaced the old Norwegian about the year 1917.  The folks saw to it
that we were faithful in our church attendance. Only unfeigned illness or inclement
weather kept us at home.
<BR>
          Dad was a typical immigrant from Norway.  His life was a difficult
way of life.  The
<BR>
mountainous terrain where he had lived afforded no space for grain pursuits.
 Many were
<BR>
discouraged at the dim prospects of owning a farm, due to the traditional custom
of inheritance.  He became restless. Anxious for a life in America and a strong
desire for a better life caused him, together with countless others, to leave
their fatherland, braving the unknown seas for a venture in an unknown land.
 Dad braced for the expected and unexpected evils of the unforgiving ocean on
its unescorted and lonely trip
<BR>
into chartered waters and unchartered dangers.
<BR>
          Tradition had it that the oldest son in the family should have a right
to the farm; others had to search for work elsewhere.  News from America may
have been exaggerated at times, but the encouragement to emigrate was all that
was needed to convince them that a journey to the new land was worthwhile.  So
with a stubborn determination and a positive attitude they forged ahead.
<BR>
          Dad was a symbol of this type.  He landed with other members of his
family in
<BR>
Montevideo, Minnesota, in July, 1881. He worked on farms for 25 cents a day and
in winter months got his room and board for his work.  After four years in that
area, the family traveled via covered wagon to Day County, South Dakota, landing
in Lynn township in 1885. Here he filed on 80 acres of land and later purchased
a quarter section from Ben Bakken on which he built his home. In 1891 he bought
the rights to a tree-claim where he planted a grove of trees that has since decorated
that land and which is mine today.
<BR>
     The pioneers rose with the sun and labored as it crossed the heavens, and
when it sank behind the western horizon they cheerfully headed home--tired but
happy in the consciousness of a day's work done.

Muriel SIGDESTAD</B> <A HREF="joyces4.jpg">(photo)</A> was born on 2 Jul 1927
in Bristol, SD.  She was baptized on 17 Jul 1927 in Bergen Luth., Bristol, SD.
 She was confirmed on 24 May 1942 in Trinity Luth., Moorhead, MN.  	While attending
summer school at Northern State Teachers' college in Aberdeen in the summer of
1927 I was called out of the classroom to answer a long-distance tele-phone call.

<BR>
When I heard the familiar voice of my cousin Selma Olson, I knew her reason for
calling.  A
<BR>
registered nurse, she informed me that I had been blessed with my first baby
daughter.  No more
<BR>
classes that day!  I rushed home to the farm where Freda was anxiously waiting.
 There, for the
<BR>
first time, I saw my lovely daughter Joyce, and we both rejoiced in her arrival.
 Now &quot;Buddy&quot;
<BR>
would have a playmate.
<BR>
          Growing up for her was not difficult.  With her ready smile and winsome
persnality she
<BR>
was a delightful addition to the family.  At school she won friends easily because
she spread joy
<BR>
wherever she went.  Kids were attracted to her, so it was not unusual to have
a yard full of them
<BR>
after school.  They were always welcome because we enjoyed them too.
<BR>
          The thought of leaving schoolmates and friends in Webster was rather
frightening at her
<BR>
age, but when we had settled in Moorhead Joyce made friends so quickly that the
adjustment was really no problem.
<BR>
          After high school Joyce attended Concordia College for a year with
teaching in mind,
<BR>
however,since they did not have a strong teachers' training course, she switched
to Moorhead
<BR>
State to get her teaching certificate.  She taught at Redwood Falls and Robbinsdale,
Minnesota.
<BR>
          In the summer of 1952 she married Walter Evenson whom she had met while
attending
<BR>
Concordia College, and who had just completed seminary training.  In the fall
of 1955 they flew
<BR>
to Africa where they served as Missionaries in the British East Africa area.
 After nearly five
<BR>
years there they returned home where Pastor Evenson served several parishes.
 They have eight children and now live in Stover, Missouri. 
<BR>
     Due to Freda's loss of hearing, aggravated by the rampant &quot;Flu,&quot;
she was advised by her
<BR>
uncle, Dr. M. D. Westley, not to have any more children.  Time went on for seven
years when we
<BR>
yearned to have another child.  This time I was teaching school in Lily, South
Dakota.  On June
<BR>
4th, 1934, I was called to the hospital in Bradley, South Dakota where I experienced
another
<BR>
added joy as I watched Mother cuddling our darling Mary June to her breast. Buddy
and Joyce
<BR>
were delighted with the news and could hardly wait for her arrival home.

<BR>
Early Days of Rasmus Sigdestad (written by him in 
<BR>
1955)
<BR>

<BR>
	I was born in Opstryn, Nordfjord, Norway on February 8,
<BR>
1868, and came to the United States in July of 1881, settling at
<BR>
Montevideo, Minnesota. My father and mother, and two
<BR>
sisters and two brothers came to Montevideo. Another sister
<BR>
went to Wells, Minnesota. Yellow Medicine County, where we
<BR>
settled, was quite new. The homes were one-room log houses,
<BR>
or sod houses dug into a side hill. My parents moved into a
<BR>
sod house a few weeks before the harvest of 1881.
<BR>

<BR>
	In the winters I helped farmers do their chores for my
<BR>
board and room. If there was some spare time I went to school.
<BR>
I had less than six months schooling in this country. My
<BR>
parents wanted all of us to have Christian training, and in 1882
<BR>
I was confirmed in Bergen Church in Yellow Medicine County,
<BR>
Minnesota.
<BR>

<BR>
	One of my sisters married Iver Skaare. They decided to
<BR>
go west and look for a free homestead. Another family by the
<BR>
name of Erik Winson decided to go too. They each had a team
<BR>
of oxen and a few cows. I went along, chasing the cows
<BR>
behind the covered wagons. We left in May of 1884 with
<BR>
Webster, Dakota Territory, as our destination.
<BR>

<BR>
	It took us a week to go from Montevideo to Webster. I
<BR>
remember we came to Webster toward evening. We drove to a
<BR>
place which is now called the Bierschbach corner and camped
<BR>
there overnight. After we had our supper, Erik Winson and I
<BR>
walked uptown. There were a hundred or more Negro soldiers
<BR>
in town. There was a saloon and I guess they had been in
<BR>
there, for most of them were very drunk. The next morning all
<BR>
the soldiers marched to Fort Sisseton.
<BR>

<BR>
	We drove out to Lynn Lake. Erik Winson had a brother
<BR>
who had proven up a quarter of land. The brother had built a
<BR>
small house but had gone back to Minnesota. He told Erik that
<BR>
they could stay in the house as long as they wished. The two
<BR>
families stayed there while Iver and Erik went looking for land
<BR>
around Lynn Lake. It was pretty well claimed by others so
<BR>
they hired John Tofley to help locate land. The Tofleys had
<BR>
been here two or three years and were acquainted. After some
<BR>
searching they found several sections in the southwest corner
<BR>
of Lynn Township. Skaare and Winson each picked out a
<BR>
quarter which they planned to file for homestead, but when
<BR>
they came to the land office they were told that the land
<BR>
Winson had chosen was already claimed or proved up.
<BR>
Winson then went north and found land four miles farther
<BR>
north and filed for a quarter there.
<BR>

<BR>
	My father, Sakris, came here the fall of 1884 and filed on a
<BR>
quarter next to my brother-in-law Iver Skaare. The spring of
<BR>
1885 my parents moved to this quarter of land. I was too
<BR>
young to file on any land, so I went back to Minnesota and
<BR>
worked for my brother-in-law, Magnus Olson, for $110 a year.
<BR>
With the $110 I bought two three-year-old steers and one cow.
<BR>
I drove them to Dakota. I sold them steers to my father who
<BR>
broke them and used them as oxen for many years, and I sold
<BR>
the cow to a neighbor. Farm work was hard to get so I went to
<BR>
Andover, where the railroad was being built from Andover to
<BR>
North Dakota. It was spring and we had a lot of rain and cold
<BR>
weather. Workers had to sleep in tents. In early summer my
<BR>
brother John, two other boys, and myself went west of Groton
<BR>
to work for two big farmers who were brothers. They were
<BR>
wheat farmers. They used four binders with two men shocking
<BR>
behind each binder. We got $1.25 a day working from about
<BR>
seven a.m. to sundown. We thought we made good money.
<BR>

<BR>
	After harvest I went back to Minnesota. The spring of
<BR>
1888 I worked for a farmer. For eight months work I was paid
<BR>
$140. With this money I bought two three-year-old mare colts
<BR>
which I drove to Lynn Township, and sold to my brother John.
<BR>
He filed on 80 acres that bordered my father's land.
<BR>

<BR>
	In 1889 I came of age and that fall I bought a
<BR>
relinquishment to a tree claim from Rasmus Larson. About 15
<BR>
acres were broken and I seeded my first crop the spring of
<BR>
1890. I had a team of horses and I broke up as much for field as
<BR>
I could. This was the first land I owned. As time went on I
<BR>
bought more land.
<BR>

<BR>
	On July 1, 1899 I married Anna Marie Gudahl of Faribault
<BR>
County, Minnesota. We bought an unfinished house and
<BR>
moved it to the present farm stead. The summer of 1900 we
<BR>
built an addition to the house and later built the farm
<BR>
buildings.
<BR>

<BR>
	Our marriage was blest with six children; three boys,
<BR>
Steward, Clarence, and Rueben; and three girls, Selma,
<BR>
Esther, and Agnes. One boy Rueben died in infancy.
<BR>

<BR>
	I am the only one left of my family. My brothers John and
<BR>
Sakris, and three sisters; Kristina, Mrs. Magnus Olson; Kari,
<BR>
Mrs. John Grove; and Ingebor, Mrs. Iver Skaare, are deceased
<BR>
and buried in Bergen Cemetery in Lynn Township.
<BR>

<BR>
	My wife Anna passed away December 21, 1954. We
<BR>
had 55 years together. Along with the hardships we had
<BR>
many happy times. God has been very good to us. He has
<BR>
blessed us in many ways
