<B>	The large county is situated between the forty-fifth and forty-sixth 
parallels of north latitude on the summit of the Coteaus of the James River, in 
a rough region sometimes designated as the "Dakota Hills," and one county 
removed from the Minnesota line.
<P>
	It embraces portions of the water sheds of the Wild Rice, the Minnesota, 
the Big Sioux, and the James rivers.  It also includes the Fort Sisseton 
Military reservation and contains a large number of lakes within its borders, 
the larger of which are Wahbay, Prairie, Blue Dog and Lake Parker in the 
southwestern part of the county.  Within the military reservation are the Kettle 
and other lakes, many of them small; and lying east of these, in the Sisseton 
and Wahpeton Indian Reservation, and many other, some of considerable size.
<P>
	The soil of the more level portions is the usual black, vegetable mold, 
which changes in the vicinity of the lakes to a more sandy character.  The 
watershed of the James River portion is very productive.  Considerable marshy 
land exists in various portions of the county, and there are important areas of 
timber in the immediate vicinity of the larger lakes, particularly around Wahbay 
Lake.
<P>
	The county embraces nearly the equivalent of nine congressional townships 
within the Sisseton and Wahpeton Indian Reservation.  The military reservation 
covers about 130 square miles.  The superficial area of the county is about 
equal to forty eight congressional town, or over 1,100,000 acres.  Oak, elm, ash 
and box elder timber are found in the vicinity of all the lakes, especially on 
their southeast sides, and in all spots sheltered from fires, coming from the 
northeast.
<P>
	Game is plentiful, including ducks, geese, snipe of all kinds, plover, 
prairie chickens, prairie pigeons, pelicans, swans and grouse.  The following 
animals are also to be found: foxes, badgers, muskrats, mink and occasionally 
antelope.
<P>
	One proposition has been demonstrated to the satisfaction of every one, 
and this, that the growth of tame grasses, especially timothy and clover, is an 
assured fact.
<P>
	The great productiveness of the soil of Day County is not the only 
recommendation.  In this particular section the facilities for stock raising are 
scarcely equaled anywhere on the continent.  The hills afford natural protection 
for cattle, hogs, and horses; their southern slopes, with but very little 
artificial aid will give ample protection against the storms of winter that are 
indigenous to every northern clime.  Among the hills in almost every basin, are 
beautiful lakes that afford abundance of pure water, while along their borders 
and in the swales and valleys grow rich, succulent grasses, that afford the very 
fines pasturage.
<P>

county seat.  At a meeting held January 8, 1882 the following officers were 
appointed: Judge of Probate, T. Lowell; Coroner, M. Johnson; Justice A. J. 
Franklin; Constable, E.C. Webster.  Mr. Johnson having declined to qualify as

<P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="graphics/1-settle.gif" WIDTH=285 HEIGHT=65 BORDER=0 ALT="FIRST SETTLEMENTS"></CENTER><P>
	 The first settlement in this county was made at Wahbay 
Lake (Wahbay in Indian signifies the place where the wild fowl congregate) as 
early as 1868 by Francis Rondelle, an Indian trader, who located at the west end 
of the lake.  In January, 1876, Albert Barse cane into the county and during the 
following month made a settlement on Section 31, Town 123, Range 54, securing a 
very fine grove of timber in the immediate vicinity of the same lake.  The next 
settler was earl P. Owen, who located at Minnewaste Lake in April, 1877.  Then 
followed the settlement of Daniel Paul at the latter lake in June, 1880.  Early 
in 1880 Joseph Gruber, Seldon Woodward and _____ Kronkuski also made settlement 
in the neighborhood of the lakes.  During this summer the Chicago, Milwaukee & 
St. Paul Railroad was graded through the major part of the county, and during 
the summer and fall settlements followed closely in the track.  The development 
of the county has since then been very rapid.  There are many beautiful lakes in 
this county, and in connection with one of them, Lake Parker, is quite an 
interesting Indian legend.
<P>
	This lake is called by the Indian Tok-niwan, which interpreted means 
"Swimming Enemy."  According to their traditions, a band of Indians were driven 
from their fellows in the south on account of their bad habits.  These Indians 
went north and sought home in the county of the Assiniboines, and having from 
time to time received accretions from other bands, became eventually quite a 
powerful people called the Lost Tribe.  Later they returned to their southern 
home, not to smoke the pipe of peace, but to avenge their supposed wrongs.  They 
found their enemies camped on the east side of the Lake Parker, in an elbow of 
the lake, where they had erected strong barricades facing the east and south, 
presuming that the lake would protect them on their western side.  But in the 
night the Lost Tribe swam the lake and, attacking them in the rear, killed them 
almost to a man.
<P>
	Blue Dog Lake is named after an Indian who settled at the east end of the 
lake.  He was called Sun-Ka-to-Kiemum, which, interpreted means "The dog that 
paints himself blue."
<P>
	Near Fort Sisseton are what are known as the Kettle Lakes- Cega-iapi--the 
French interpretation of which is Sounding Kettle, and the American, Talking 
Kettle.  it seems that the Indians at one time found an iron kettle which giving 
forth a ringing sound, caused them to name the lakes accordingly.  Minnewaste or 
"Good Water Lake," is as its name denotes, a beautiful sheet of water, with a 
gravelly bottom and high banks.  
<P>
	There are in this county well-defined remains of the mound builders.  Mr. 
Barse thinks that at one time an extensive pottery manufactory had ben 
established on his farm, as there are chippings of flint, and broken pottery of 
all kinds is found there.
<P>
	WEBSTER:-- Mr. J.P. Webster came into this county in June, 1880 and 
selected as his homestead this town site June 5.  He was at that time the only 
settler in the county west of the Wahbay settlement.  The Chicago, Milwaukee & 
St. Paul Railroad Company located their road and commenced grading in the 
vicinity of Webster about June 20, the first train arriving on October 27, 1880.  
Mr. Webster and his family remained there the entire winter, the house standing 
a little south of the present town site.
<P>
	During this fall E. R. Ruggles and B. D. Fish located in the vicinity, but 
did not make a permanent settlement until the following spring.  The winter 
1880-1881 is noted throughout the entire West as one of unusual length and 
severity, and this little settlement was consequently cut off from communication 
with the outer world until May 15, 1881.  On this day the long blockade was 
raised and the first train reached Webster.  The following persons soon after 
came in and took up claims in the vicinity, viz.; E. Knapp, E. Babcock, Charles 
Wright, E. A. Smail, J. C. Bush, John Norton, E. Balzer and L. J. Ochsenritter.
<P>
	The town was platted in June, 1881.  E. Smail was the first person to 
decide on building, and erected part of the store now occupied by John Norton.  
On its completion, in connection with Mr. Norton, he commenced a general 
merchandising business.  The old part of the Balzar House was finished shortly 
after, and but few other improvements were made during this year.  In 1882 
several business houses were erected and the town began to put on metropolitan 
airs.
<P>
	In 1883 there was an activity in building operations that produced 
splendid results.  Residences, public buildings and business houses of all kinds 
were erected, and during this season the improvements amounted to the 
considerable sum of $27,000.  Among these improvements we may mention the 
Congregational church building, the high school building and the court-house.  
The former is a large structure, 30 by 54 ground dimensions and 22 feet ceiling.  
It has a seating capacity of about 200 and is finished, both inside and out, 
with modern appliances.  It is a decided ornament to the town.
<P>
	The high school building is situated in the northeast part of the town.  
It is 44 feet square and 30 feet high, having two assembly room, above and 
below, besides wardrobes, halls and a belfry and clock town, in which hangs a 
genuine Meneely bell, weighing 600 pounds.  A school has been in operation 
during the past winter, with H.E. Wilson as principal.  Miss Frane Moulton 
assistant and Prof. H.D. Root as musical director.  The average attendance has 
been eighty-five and the school is rapidly growing in the confidence of the 
general public.  The officers are M. M. Moulton, director; E. C. Warner, clerk 
and Frank Wallace, treasurer.
<P>
	The court-house, situated west of Main street, near the heart of the city, 
is an imposing structure, 30 by 36 feet in size.  There are four offices below, 
with a hallway through the center, and a stairway leading to a large court room 
and two jury rooms in the second story.  The building is handsomely painted and 
is a comely edifice, capable of accommodating the county business for several 
years.  The building and grounds are paid for.
<P>
	Beside these, the city is supplied with a commodious Opera House, with a 
finely equipped Masonic lodge room on the second floor.  Its benevolent 
societies are, one Masonic lodge, one Sons of Industry, one Good Templars and 
preliminary steps have been taken to organize a Royal Arch Masonic lodge and an 
Odd Fellow's lodge.
<P>
	Webster is the supply point for Fort Sisseton and Britton.  a daily stage 
runs to these two points, a triweekly to Watertown and a weekly to Lake Lynn and 
Wahbay Lake.  The Iowa, Sioux Falls & Northern Railway will probably enter the 
county at the southeastern corner, traverse its whole length and leave it at the 
northwestern corner.
<P>
	The pioneer paper of the county, the Reporter & Farmer. made its first 
appearance September 7, 1881,  the publisher being Mr. A. C. Tuttle.  The paper 
was purchased October 1, 1883, by Messrs. J. C. Adams & Son.  Since coming to 
Webster, Mr. Adams has begun the publication of the Daylight, at a point known 
as Giles City, on the northeast quarter of Section 6, Town 126, range 57, forty 
miles from a railway and fourteen miles from a post office.  The Daylight is 
managed by Mr. E. A. Baker and first made its appearance June 7, 1883.  Mr. 
Adams has been engaged in journalism for thirty years and for the past thirteen 
years resided in Avoca, Iowa, where he published the Avoc Delta, a paper which 
wields considerable influence throughout that portion of Iowa.
<P>
	The Day County Bank was opened in the fall of 1883 by Mr. J. alley.  The 
estimated population of the town is about 500.
<P>
	ANDOVER;--  In May, 1881, Geo. Bryant located just west of the present 
town site of Andover, and at about the same time Messrs. A. K. Johnson, A. A. 
Johnson, Marshall Vincent and Arthur A. Bryant located on adjoining sections. 
These were the only parties who located here in that year, with the exception of 
the Misses Ellen and Nellie Bryant.  The railroad reached Andover in the last 
days of June.  The town site had been platted by the spring of 1882 that the 
town showed decided growth.  Mr. Webster's store was built in February, 1882 and 
in March or April of the same year the Andover House was built.  These building 
together with a small structure put up by Mr. Taylor, were the only improvements 
made in 1882.  In the spring of 1883, the town had a regular boom, and building 
of all kinds were up as it were in the twinkling of an eye.  it is now a 
prosperous town of some 200 inhabitants.
<P>
	The Andover Gazette was first issued in June, 1883, by Messrs. Bryneldsen 
& Stickles.  It is a lively and well conducted sheet.
<P>
	BRISTOL:-- This is a promising town on the Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul 
Railway line, situated about half way between Webster and Andover, where it 
commands a fair share of trade and general business.
<P>
	An enterprising newspaper, the Bristol Herald, is published by Messrs. 
Sharrett & Balser.  The first issue made its appearance August 2, 1883
<P>
	BRITTON:--This lively town is situated in the northwestern part of the 
county, in Town 127 north, Range 58 west, near a branch of the Wild Rice River 
in the midst of a fine agricultural region, having a rich black soil from five 
to fifteen feet in depth, underlaid with a clay subsoil.
<P>
	The town is located on a slight ridge separating two valleys and 
commanding a splendid view over the "Broad Valley" to the north and west; the 
"pleasant Valley" to the southwest and the beautiful "Hills" and lakes of the 
military reservation to the southeast.
<P>
	The Dakota & Great Southern Railway makes this town an important point on 
its line and will locate division shops here.  The place is named in honor of 
Col. Isac Britton, general manage of the road, and a well known railway 
contractor and builder.
<P>
	Among improvements now in progress are a three story hotel, several 
general stores, a number of elevators, a banking house and several lumber yards.  
A newspaper has recently been established.  The country in the vicinity is well 
settled with an energetic and industrious class of people, and present 
indications point to a prosperous and wealthy community at no distant day.
<P>
	About 320 acres have been platted into city lots and a rapid settlement 
and upbuilding is anticipated.  Several additional railway lines are expected to 
make Britton a crossing point.
