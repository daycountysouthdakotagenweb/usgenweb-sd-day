<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>ROBERT
J. McVICKER. </span></b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>The
general store at Vermilion owned by Robert J. McVicker is considered one of the
best in that section of the state. Mr. McVicker is a native of Pennsylvania,
born May 4, 1864, of the marriage of Simpson M. and Eliza (Wilson) McVicker.
The father was a farmer and in 1865 removed with his family to Illinois, where
he resided for six years. A removal was then made to Iowa, where he purchased
land and where he also owned what was known as the Hawley stage station, which
was soon afterward discontinued. He purchased additional land from time to time
and devoted his energies to farming throughout his active life. Both he and his
wife died in the Hawkeye State in 1880. They had eight children: Elmer E., a
minister of the gospel at Corvallis, Oregon; Robert J.; Ella, the wife of H. C.
Tuttle, of Canada; Lizzie J., the wife of Fred Talcot, of Webb City, Iowa, who
is principal of the school at Blairsburg, Iowa; Clarence, engaged in the meat
business at Clarion, Iowa; Willa, the wife of George Garth, a farmer residing
near Webster City; Albert B., who is engaged in farming near Ackley, Iowa; and
Ernest A., who lives in Smith Center, Kansas. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>Robert
J. McVicker was seven years of age when the family removed from Illinois to
Iowa and at that early age he assisted his brother Elmer in driving a team from
one state to the other, the journey requiring three weeks. He assisted his
father with the work of the farm and after the latter's death operated the
homestead for two years. As he was compelled by circumstances to devote most of
his time to work even when a boy, he received but little training in the
schools. When but nine years of age he did a man's work upon the farm and when
eighteen years old he entered the employ of a merchant of Webster City,
receiving a salary of ten dollars per month and his board. He continued in that
connection for two years and then went to Blairsburg, where with money that he
had earned and saved he opened a grocery store, in partnership with his former
employer, under the firm name of R. J. McVicker &amp; Company. The store was
conducted for two years by that firm, which then sold out. Mr. McVicker
returned to his former position as clerk, but after a year bought a general store,
which was carried on under the name of McVicker &amp; Christman for one year.
At the end of that time he bought his partner's interest and continued to
conduct the store alone. In the meantime, in order to induce a physician to
locate in his little town, he opened a drug store and placed it in charge of
him. In 1891 Mr. McVicker commenced a small banking business in his store and
after six months organized a stock company which established the Exchange Bank
of Blairsburg, of which he was elected cashier. Six months after accepting that
position he disposed of his store, exchanging it for a farm. He continued as
cashier of the Exchange Bank of Blairsburg until 1893 and then sold his
interest in that institution and severed his official connection therewith. He
removed to Vermilion, South Dakota, where, on the 9th of March 1894, he entered
business circles as a member of the firm of Grange &amp; McVicker, owners of a
general merchandise store, the senior partner being J. W. Grange. In 1910 Mr.
McVicker sold out to his partner and for about three years conducted stores in
different places but during that time maintained his residence in Vermilion. On
the 28th of January 1912, he purchased a small stock of groceries in Vermilion
and also the Anderson building. A few months later he purchased the adjoining
building and increased the business considerably, handling a full line of dry
goods, boots, shoes, etc. At the beginning of his venture he hired one clerk
but now has eight employed regularly. He owns a fine residence on Main Street
in Vermilion, and also holds title to land in North Dakota.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'><span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Mr. McVicker was married the first time to
Miss Carrie Grange, a native of Dubuque, Iowa, their wedding occurring in 1892.
They became the parents of two children: Hazel G., who is teaching English at
Platte, South Dakota; and Carrie N., who is attending the University of South
Dakota at Vermilion and preparing herself for kindergarten work. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>In
January, 1895, the wife and mother died and later Mr. McVicker married Miss
Priscilla Grange, a sister of his first wife. To them was born a daughter,
Ethlyn, who is now in high school. Mrs. McVicker died in 1905 and in 1909 Mr.
McVicker married Miss Edith Spencer, a native of South Dakota. Mr. McVicker is
a republican and while living in Iowa was township clerk. He has served as city
assessor of Vermilion for one year but has never been a seeker for office He is
a trustee of the Methodist Episcopal Church and is devoted to the work of that
organization. Fraternally he is a member of the blue lodge, chapter, commandery
and Shrine of the Masons and has taken the thirty-second degree in the Scottish
Rite. He is likewise a prominent member of the Independent Order of Odd
Fellows, having held all of the chairs in the subordinate lodge and encampment
and being a member of the canton. He has gained material prosperity for himself
by building up a prosperous general store and in so doing has also contributed
to the development and growth of his city along commercial lines. He is
esteemed for his upright character as well as for his business ability and is
valued resident of Vermilion. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
