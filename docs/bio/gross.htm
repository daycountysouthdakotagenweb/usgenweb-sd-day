style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>, of Webster, Day County, is
a native of Sweden, where he was born on the 23d of May, 1865, being a son of
Benjamin and Johanna Gross, of whose four children he was the second in order
of birth. The subject was reared in his fatherland and there received his
educational training in the well-equipped national schools. At the age of
sixteen years he immigrated to America and located in Hutchinson, Minnesota,
where he was employed until the spring of 1884, when he went to Illinois, where
he passed the summer. He then returned to Minnesota and there remained until
the autumn of 1885, when he came to Day County, South Dakota. In the following
year he purchased relinquishment claims and turned his attention to farming,
developing and improving his property and continuing to be successfully
identified with agricultural pursuits until the autumn of 1892, when he rented
his ranch and took up his residence in the town of Webster. Here he found
employment in connection with the management of the lumbering business
conducted by H. O. Frank, with whom he remained in this capacity for two years,
after which he was for six years employed by Mr. Frank in the buying and
shipping of grain. He then entered into the employ of the Miller Elevator
Company, and they have since conducted a most prosperous business, the concern
having a well-equipped elevator and controlling a large and important business.
Mr. Gross is a man of indefatigable industry and it may be noted in this
connection that during his eleven years' residence in Webster he has never lost
a day's pay, having always been found at his assigned post. He is the owner of
a valuable farm of three hundred and twenty acres, one mile distant from
Webster, and is also the owner of village property, having four dwellings in
Webster and renting three of the same, as does he also his farm. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>In
his political proclivities Mr. Gross is a staunch adherent of the Republican
party, and takes a deep interest in public affairs of a local nature. He is a
member of the city council of Webster, and in 1904 was made the nominee of his
party for the office of sheriff of the county. Fraternally he is identified
with the lodge and encampment of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows, and also
with the Ancient Order of United Workmen and the Modern Woodmen of America. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>On
the 7th of June 1890, Mr. Gross was united in marriage to Miss Emma Olsen, who
was born in Sweden, and they have five children, Vina, Cora, Mabel, Herman and
Dewey. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
