<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>ANTON
KARPEN</span></b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>.
Anton Karpen is secretary and manager of the Farmers Lumber Company of Webster
and his progressive spirit and devotion to the general good is further
indicated in the fact that he is president of the Commercial Club of the town.
Minnesota claims him as a native son, his birth having occurred in Nicollet
county, that state, on the 9th of October, 1877, his parents being Valentine
and Magdalena (Dorn) Karpen, both of whom were natives of Germany. The former
was born April 30, 1846, and was a son of Peter Karpen, who passed away in
Nicollet county at the age of eighty-six years. The mother of Anton Karpen was
also born in 1846 and was a daughter of Mathias Dorn, who also passed away in
Nicollet County when he had reached the venerable age of eighty-six. Both
Valentine Karpen and Magdalena Dorn had come to the United States in childhood
with their respective parents, who settled in Wisconsin. They were both
educated in that state and there remained until after their marriage, removing
to Minnesota in the early '70s. Mr. Karpen purchased a farm in Nicollet county
and there engaged in general agricultural pursuits until his death. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>He
was active in community affairs, was a stalwart supporter of the Democratic
Party and held various township and school offices. His religious faith was
that of the Catholic Church. He was a self-made and self-educated man, became
widely known throughout his county and was highly respected by all. He died in
1908, while his wife passed away in 1879. They were the parents of six
children: Mathias, a well-to-do citizen now living at New Ulm, Minnesota; Mary,
the wife of William Miller, a retired farmer, now proprietor of a restaurant
and pool hall at Webster, South Dakota; Hubert, living on the old homestead in
Minnesota; Anna Lucy, the wife of L. Giefer, a Minnesota farmer; Anton; and
Peter, who is a general merchant and postmaster at Medina, North Dakota. Anton
Karpen was educated in the common schools of his county and the high school of
Glencoe, Minnesota, and was graduated with the- class of 1898. He followed
teaching for three years after which he entered the lumber business, accepting
a position with the Lampert Lumber Company as manager of their Cleveland,
Minnesota, yard. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>On
the 8th of January, 1906, he arrived in South Dakota, where he assumed the
management of the business of the Lampert Lumber Company, in which connection
he continued for three years, when he resigned and entered into partnership
with Mr. Mohs in the conduct of a furniture business. Some time later, however,
he sold his interest in that connection and bought out the lumber company in October
1911, now conducting his interests under the name of the Farmers Lumber
Company, of which he is the secretary and treasurer. He also owns another yard
at Eden, South Dakota, and is enjoying a liberal patronage, his business having
now reached extensive and gratifying proportions. He is always reliable in his
dealings and progressive in his methods and his unfailing enterprise has
brought him growing success. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>In
1898 Mr. Karpen was united in marriage to Miss Mary A. Albers, who was born at
Shakopee, Minnesota, and was educated in the schools of Glencoe, that state, to
which place her parents removed when she was but a year old. Mr. and Mrs.
Karpen have a family of five children: Esther, attending the high school;
Genevieve Anna, Antonio and Helen Marie, all in school; and Alice. Mr. and Mrs.
Karpen are members of the Catholic Church and he holds membership in the
Knights of Columbus and the Catholic Order of Foresters. He belongs also to the
German Society of Minnesota. In politics he is a democrat and when a candidate
for the office of county clerk in Nicollet county, Minnesota, he received every
vote in his township save two but was defeated by a majority of forty-eight
although the republicans usually polled a majority of about eight hundred. The vote,
which he received, was certainly very flattering and indicated his personal
popularity and the confidence reposed in him. Mr. Karpen is greatly interested
in the good roads movement and is the executive member for the state of the
Yellowstone Trail, giving generously of his time and money to the project of
building this road, which is a connecting highway between the Falls of St.
Anthony and the Falls of the Yellowstone and which is now being extended from
coast to coast. His interest in the welfare of his home city is indicated in
the fact that he is president of the Commercial Club. He is a capable businessman
and above all a public-spirited citizen and is making his work and his
influence count for good. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
