<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>William
G. Wa</span></b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>ddel,
a well known member of the Day county bar and now filling the office of states
attorney at Webster, was born in Grant county, Wisconsin, June 29, 1870, and is
descended from Scotch ancestry that was early established on American soil. His
ancestors went into Kentucky with Daniel Boone and aided in colonizing the
&quot;dark and bloody ground.&quot; William Waddel, the grandfather of William
G. Waddel, was born in Ohio and at an early day removed to Wisconsin, where he
followed the occupation of farming and spent the remainder of his life. His
son, W. W. Waddel, was born in Wisconsin in 1842, was reared to farm work and
also learned and followed the carpenter's trade for a time. He also worked in
the lead mines of Wisconsin prior to the Civil war. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>He
married Elizabeth Garner, who was born in the Badger State in 1849, a daughter
of Daywald Garner, and a native of Pennsylvania, who removed to Wisconsin in
1851 and there resided until called to his final rest. Mr. and Mrs. W. W.
Waddel continued to make their home in that state until 1874, when they removed
to Iowa. They became the parents of eight children, seven of whom survive:
William G.; Thomas Warren, now living upon a farm in Iowa; Arthur, a resident
farmer of Day county; Reuben, who follows farming in tile same county; Nellie,
the wife of Myron Kanago, who lives upon a farm in Day county; and Fred and
Edward both of whom are farming in Day county. The father was a successful man,
carefully directing his business affairs and improving his opportunities until
he was the possessor of a handsome competence, being financially well off at
the time of his death, which occurred in November, 1912. His widow survives. He
attended the Methodist Episcopal Church and in his political belief was a
republican. William G. Waddel was but four years of age when his parents left
Wisconsin for Iowa and in the public schools of the latter state he pursued his
preliminary education. He was afterward graduated from the College of Law of
the State University of South Dakota with the class of 1904 and entered upon
the active practice of his chosen profession at Webster, this state, in
connection with E. L. Sheldon, who was the first law student enrolled in the
State University, while Mr. Waddel was the second. Their partnership was
continued for two years and at the present time Mr. Waddel is a partner of
Frank Anderson, their legal business being conducted under the firm style of
Anderson &amp; Waddel. He has secured a liberal clientage and his practice has
been of an important character. He has proven himself able to cope with
involved legal problems and to find for them a correct solution and it is well
known that he is most careful and painstaking in the preparation of his cases. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>In
1900 Mr. Waddel was united in marriage to Miss Eliza M. Otis, who was born in
Union county, South Dakota, a daughter of John J. Otis, who was a miller and
millwright and built some of the first mills in South Dakota, having removed to
this state, then a territory, in 1877. To Mr. and Mrs. Waddel have been born
four children: Sterling, twelve years of age, the first son born to any law
graduate of the State University; Garner, aged ten; Kenneth, seven; and Harold,
five years of age. The family attends the Methodist Episcopal Church and Mr.
Waddel belongs to the Knights of Pythias fraternity. His political endorsement
is given to the Republican Party and upon that ticket he was elected to the
office of states attorney in 1912 and again in 1914. His entire attention is
given to the duties of his position and to his private law practice. He also
has farming interests in Day County, owning a good tract of land. His has been
an active life crowned with a gratifying measure of success that is the fitting
reward of his intelligently applied effort and his close adherence to the high
ideals of the profession. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
