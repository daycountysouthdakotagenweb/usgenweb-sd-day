style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>, one of the representative
businessmen of Groton, Brown County, has been a conspicuous figure in the
development and advancement of that thriving city. He is engaged in the
business of photography and was the first artist to establish in the town. He
now has an excellent trade, and aside from his gallery, which he personally
conducts, he has enlarged his business and now has five galleries in different
parts of the state. His extensive business has been the outcome of judicious
management and from a limited start he has become one of the substantial men of
his locality. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>Our
subject was born in Koln, Germany, in 1853. His father, Peter Steinhauer,
served three years in the German army and was by trade a locksmith. He came to
America in 1865 and was accidentally killed in 1867. A heavy bucket used in
well digging fell sixty-six feet to the bottom of the well, striking him and
causing his death. The mother of our subject, whose maiden name was Catherine
Sunday, was the daughter of a wagon maker. Her death occurred August 28, 1899,
aged seventy-six years, and she was laid to rest in the Catholic cemetery at
St. Paul. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>Of
a family of five children our subject was the second in order of birth. He
attended the German Catholic schools of his native village, and his English
education was acquired through his own teachings. He came to America with his
parents and the family settled on a farm at Hastings, Minnesota. At the age of
fourteen years he left home and learned the harness maker's trade. He worked at
this seven and a half years in Minnesota, and then engaged in the restaurant
business at Cannon Falls, Minnesota, remaining in the business nine months and
then spent one year tending bar. He started to learn photography in 1879, and
after completing the course traveled in Minnesota as an artist for a year and a
half, and in the fall of 1881 went to Groton, South Dakota, and established a
business. He rented rooms on the second floor above a store, and remained in
that location five years. He then purchased property where he conducted his
business until January, 1888, when he sold his interests, but began business
again later in the spring of the same year. He built a car with the intention
of traveling, but established permanently in the city, and later purchased the
site of his present building, and erected a two-story block, 20 x 30, with an
addition 14 x 28 feet. He has residence property in the city, which he rents at
a good figure, and also owns business and residence lots and the entire
possessions, including the photographing outfits, are without indebtedness. In
1897, in partnership with C. T. Hilldahl, he purchased a building in Pierpont,
Day county, South Dakota,and established a department store, stocking it with a
four-thousand-dollar stock of general merchandise, and in connection I they
also conduct an implement business. He has made a success in both the
mercantile business and the photograph studio, and he and his wife are kept
busy with the business in their Groton gallery. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>Our
subject was married October 20, 1877, to Miss Emma Janette Miller, daughter of
William Miller, a hotelkeeper and farmer. Mrs. Steinhauer was born in Goodhue
County, Minnesota, and was of English parentage. Four children have been born
to Mr. and Mrs. Steinhauer, as follows: Mattie died in infancy; William R.,
born at Whiterock, Minnesota, in October, 1881; Mattie, born in Dakota, in
1883; and Janette, born in Dakota, in 1897. Our subject is a member of the
Knights of Maccabees and the Independent Order of Odd Fellows, and in the last
named he has been a representative to the Grand Lodge. Politically he is a Democrat,
and has attended numerous county conventions of his party. He takes an active
interest in local affairs and has served as a member of the city council. He is
a man of much energy and uprightness, and deserves a prominent place in the
minds of the citizens of Brown County. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
