<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>CHARLES
W. SIGLINGER</span></b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>,
the senior member of the firm of Siglinger &amp; Wickre, butchers and live
stock dealers, Webster, Day county, is one of the best known business men of
that thriving town. Mr. Siglinger was born on the 16th of September 1859, in
Marion County, Illinois. His parents, Gottlieb and Sophia Siglinger, were both
natives of Germany, and came to this country about the year 1858. They had
three children, two sons and a daughter. Both of his parents died before our
subject was six months old, and an aunt brought him up. He attended the schools
of his native state, and until his nineteenth year worked upon a farm. He then
went to Yellow Medicine, Minnesota, and secured a position as a clerk in a
general store. He remained there until the spring of 1883, when he removed to
Webster, South Dakota, soon afterward becoming a clerk in the store of John
Norton at that place. He continued in the employ of Mr. Norton until 1888, when
he was elected to the office of sheriff of Day County, which he held for two
years. In 1890 Mr. Siglinger went into the cattle buying and shipping business,
which he continued very successfully until 1893. He then formed a partnership
with Mr. A. A. Sandvig under the firm name of Sandvig &amp; Siglinger, and
together they established the present live-stock and implement concern. In the spring
of 1895 Mr. Sandvig retired and his interest was purchased by Mr. H. O. Wickre,
who has since been connected with the firm. Two years later the butcher
business was added. Messrs. Siglinger and Wickre have been very successful in a
business way, and it may safely besaid that to-day the firm controls as large a
trade in the goods which it handles as any house in Day county, and is rated
among the most solid and substantial commercial enterprises in that section.
Mr. Siglinger is a Republican in politics, but with the exception of one term
as sheriff, already mentioned, he has never held public office. He is a member
of the Masonic fraternity and the A. O. U. W. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>On
the 14th of July, 1886, Mr. Siglinger married Miss Amelia C. Moulton, a
resident of Webster, and a daughter of M. M. and Amelia Moulton. Mr. and Mrs.
Siglinger are the parents of five children: Ethel; Ira and Ina, twins; Jessie;
and Charles, the latter being deceased.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
