style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>, one of the representative
business men of Webster, Day county, is a native of the city of Philadelphia,
Pennsylvania, where he was born on the 30th of June, 1858, being a son of
Robert and Mary (Scott) Arthur, both of whom were born in Ireland. As a young
man the father of our subject left his old home in the northern part. of the
Emerald Isle and came to America, settling in Philadelphia, where he was for
many years engaged in the coal business, becoming successful in his endeavors
and continuing to reside in the fair old City of Brotherly Love until his
death, which occurred in 1902, his wife having passed away in 1871. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

W. Arthur, the immediate subject of this review, completed the curriculum of
the public schools in his native city and then entered Crittenden College, in
the same city, where he was graduated as a member of the class of 1875. He then
learned the drug business, with which he there continued to be identified until
1884, when he came to South Dakota, bringing a number of car loads of live
stock and settling in Day County, where he continued to be engaged in the
raising of stock for a number of years, after which he became identified with
newspaper work. He purchased an interest in the Reporter and Farmer, published
in Webster, South Dakota, and continued to be associated in its editorial and
business management until 1901, when he disposed of his interests in the line.
In 1898 he was appointed postmaster of Webster, retaining this incumbency until
1902, and giving a most satisfactory administration. Since that time he has
been established in the real-estate business, controlling valuable farming and
grazing lands in this section of the state, as well as improved and unimproved
town property, and having at all times represented on his books many desirable
investments. He is especially interested in realty in Webster, where he has
built a large number of houses. In politics Mr. Arthur is a stanch and
uncompromising advocate of the principles of the Republican party, and he has
taken an active part in the promotion of its cause in the state of his
adoption, having held membership on both the county and state central
committees and been a delegate to the various conventions of his party. He is
affiliated with the lodge and chapter of the Masonic fraternity and also with the
Independent Order of Odd Fellows and the Ancient Order of United Workmen.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>In
1885 Mr. Arthur was united in marriage to Miss Clara F. McDougall, who was born
in Sparta, Wisconsin, being a daughter of Peter and Elizabeth (Farrington)
McDougall, who were born and reared in Maine, being representatives of stanch
old colonial stock, while the records establish the fact that members of the
Farrington family were soldiers of the Continental line during the war of the
Revolution. Mrs. Arthur was summoned into eternal rest on the 29th of December
1897, and is survived by three children, Robert, Irene and Walter Scott. The
elder son is now attending the United States Military Academy at West Point,
being one of the youngest cadets in the institution. On the 30th of June 1903,
Mr. Arthur wedded Mrs. Mary Ella Whitemore, of Stillwater, Minnesota.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
