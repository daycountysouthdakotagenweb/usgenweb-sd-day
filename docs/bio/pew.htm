<p class=MsoNormal>FRED S. PEW admirably typifies the progressive spirit and
conservative business judgment which have made the young men of the great west
so important factors in all branches of industrial activity and civic
advancement. He is vice-president of the Citizens' State Bank, of Andover;
president of the Day County Land Company and president of the Andover Hotel
Company, while he has other important capitalistic interests. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Mr. Pew was born in Madrid, St. Lawrence county, New York,
August 19, 1861, being a son of George W. and Nancy A. Pew, both of whom were
likewise born in the old Empire state, being of Irish lineage. The subject
received his early educational training in the public schools of his native
town, and there remained until he had attained the age of twenty years, when,
in the spring of 1881, he accompanied his parents on their removal to the
territory of Dakota. In the spring of 1883 he located in Andover, Day county,
and here he was actively and successfully engaged in the livery business until
1890, while from that time forward to 1898 he was engaged in the real estate
and loan business. He was one of the organizers of the Day County Land Company
in 1898, and when the same was incorporated under the laws of the state, in
1902, he was made president of the company, which position he still retains,
the company being capitalized for one hundred thousand dollars and controlling
an extensive and profitable business in the handling of lands in South Dakota
and the extending of first-mortgage loans. Mr. Pew has also held the office of
vice-president of the Citizens' State Bank of Andover from the time of its
organization, in July, 1902, the institution being incorporated with fifteen
thousand dollars capital and being one of the solid banks of the state. Mr. Pew
was the prime factor in the organization of the Andover Hotel Company, which
erected the fine modern hotel known as the Waldorf, in Andover, in 1903, and of
this company he is president, while he is a member of the directorate of other
important corporations in the town.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>In politics Mr. Pew
is a staunch advocate of the principles of the Republican party, and he takes
an active interest in public affairs, being at the time of this writing mayor
of Andover and also secretary of the board of education, while he commands the
unequivocal confidence and esteem of the community to whose advancement and
prosperity he has so materially contributed through the various enterprises
with which he is identified. He is a communicant of the Roman Catholic church,
and fraternally he holds membership in the Ancient Order of United Workmen, the
Modern Woodmen of America, the Knights of the Maccabees and the Degree of
Honor. </p>

Pew to Miss Jennie M. Miller, who was born in Decatur, Illinois, on the 28th of
December, 1858, being a- daughter of Joseph S. and Mary Miller. Of this union
have been born two sons, Frank M. and Fred E. </p>
