<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>REV.
WALTER J. EDGAR</span></b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt'> has for over three decades been an ordained minister of the Wesleyan
Methodist church and since 1904 has been president of the Wesleyan Methodist
conference. He was born in Brighton, Michigan, November 20, 1852, a son of
Robert and Nancy (Whalen) Edgar. The Edgar family is of Scotch-Irish origin and
Robert Edgar was a native of Ireland. His wife was born in Canada but reared in
Vermont. He became a pioneer of Michigan, arriving in that state in 1832. He
lived to an advanced age, dying in 1880 when eighty-one years of age, and was
buried in the Baptist cemetery, in Brighton township, Livingston county,
Michigan. After his death his widow brought the family to South Dakota and she
passed away in this state in 1892, at the age of eighty-four years, interment
being made at Webster. Walter J. Edgar received his education in Brighton,
Michigan, and then taught for a number of years in the public schools of that
state and South Dakota. He desired to become a minister of the gospel, however,
and in 1883 was ordained pastor of the Wesleyan Methodist church. For over three
decades he has been a faithful servant of the cause of Christ and his labors
have been productive of much good in the communities where he has preached. For
fourteen years he was stationed in Brookings county, his length of service
there being all indication of the hold which he had upon the hearts of his
people. Although an effective pulpit speaker much of his influence has been due
to his truly Christian life, which has preached more effectively than it is
possible for mere words to do. In addition to his work as a minister Rev. Edgar
has devoted some time to the management of his farms. In 1881 he took up a
homestead three and one-half miles northeast of Mellette and also entered a
tree claim. He broke the land, which was wild, and brought it to a high state
of cultivation but eventually leased the homestead and sold the tree claim. He
then bought three hundred and twenty acres in Brookings county, which he held
until 1913, when he sold it and bought another three hundred and twenty acres
north of Cresbard. He rents this farm, which is in a high state of cultivation
and well improved. He is at present building a residence thereon and making
other improvements. Rev. Edgar has been married twice, his first union being
with Miss Sarah King, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Richard King, both of whom are
deceased and are buried near Benton Harbor, Michigan. The marriage was
solemnized in the Wolverine state. Mrs. Edgar passed away in Bushnell,
Brookings county, South Dakota, and was buried in the Brookings cemetery. She
was the mother of four children, namely: Margery, the wife of Lawrence
Phillbrook, who resides near Webster, this state; Elmer J., a farmer living hi
the same locality; Bessie, who is a graduate of the high school and has taught
for eleven years, her home being with her parents; and Edith, the wife of
Blanchard Smith, a resident of Brookings. On the 15th of September, 1909, Rev.
Edgar was married, in Northville, to Mrs. Mary Martin, a daughter of Thomas J.
and Hannah (Tucker) Thompson, pioneers of that part of South Dakota. Mrs. Edgar
has six children by her first marriage: Earl L., who is engaged in farming near
Northville; Glen R., a resident of Aberdeen; Fern, the wife of William R. Hall,
of Northville; Frank T., also of Northville; and Floyd W. and Pearl A., both at
home. Rev. Edgar is a prohibitionist and his advice is much sought in the
councils of that party, which at one time made him its candidate for governor.
He has been instrumental in furthering all good movements, both those directly connected
with the church and those inaugurated by other organizations, feeling that all
who desire the triumph of righteousness should unite in their efforts to bring
about a better and higher condition of affairs. To his own people he is a
trusted counselor and spiritual adviser, and he holds the sincere respect of
all with whom he has come in contact whether of his denomination or of any
church affiliation. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
