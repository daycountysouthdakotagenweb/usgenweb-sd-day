<p class=MsoNormal>Seventeen years have come and gone since Dr. David F.
Sullivan began the practice of medicine and surgery in Frankfort. His residence
in the state covers a third of a century, for be arrived in South Dakota in
1882, removing from Fort Ellis, Montana, to Fort Sisseton, South Dakota. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He was born at Sinsinawa Mound, Wisconsin, on the 10th of
May, 1843, and is a son of Dennis and Catherine Sullivan, natives of Ireland,
who crossed the Atlantic from the Emerald isle to the new world and took up
their abode in Wisconsin, where Mr. Sullivan engaged in operating in the lead mines.
Both he and his wife had passed away when David F. Sullivan was but nine years
of age. Dr. Sullivan acquired his education in St. Joseph College at Sinsinawa
Mound, from which he was graduated in 1867. He then taught school and afterward
attended the Homeopathic Medical College of Pennsylvania at Philadelphia, then
the first and only homeopathic medical college in the world. It later
affiliated with the Hahnemann Medical College of Philadelphia, by which name it
is now known. He was graduated in 1869, winning his professional degree. He
went abroad for further study, entering the Royal Medical College of Dublin,
Ireland, from which he was graduated in 1876, again receiving the M. D. degree.
Subsequently he completed a course in the law department of the University of
Illinois, with the class of 1897, and the degree of LL.B. was conferred upon
him. Dr. Sullivan began the practice of medicine in Philadelphia and thence
removed to Reedsburg, Wisconsin, where he followed his profession for some
time. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He next removed to Union Center, Wisconsin, where in
partnership with Dr. Gilluly he purchased a drug store and office. There he
continued in practice until he went to Chicago, where he suffered losses
through the great fire of October 1871. He next went to Fort Ellis, Montana, as
medical director for the Thirteenth United States Infantry, which position he
filled until 1881, when he was transferred to Fort Sisseton, South Dakota. In
1882 he resigned and settled at Andover, Day county. He took up three-quarter
sections by homestead, preemption and soldier's declaratory. He continued to
practice medicine and in 1897 he removed to Frankfort to take up actively his
profession, which he followed until 1915, when he retired to private life. In
the intervening years he made substantial progress in this field, his ability
gaining him wide recognition as an able and learned physician. He has also
dealt quite largely in real estate and is the owner of considerable farm land
and city properties. He has improved both town and country property and has
thus added much to the material development of the community in which he lives.

<p class=MsoNormal>In 1879, at Union Center, Wisconsin, Dr. Sullivan was united
in marriage to Miss Hattie Shannon, a daughter of William and Minnie (Boom)
Shannon. She passed away in 1897, leaving a son and daughter. Dennis William, a
graduate of the University of South Dakota at Vermillion and the Ensworth
Medical College of St. Joseph, Missouri, is now manager of the Fort William
baseball tram in the Northern League. He is well known as a professional ball
player, having been in the American League for eleven years before retiring to
the management of teams in the minor leagues. His winter seasons have been
devoted to the acquirement of his education and to practice. In 1914 he was
head physician at Ensworth Deaconess Hospital at St. Joseph, Missouri. He
married Nellie M. Hanson, of Chokio, Minnesota, and they have become the
parents of one daughter, Catherine Beatty. Nellie, a graduate of the State
Normal School at Madison, South Dakota, is the wife of George Newsome, of
Wardner, Idaho. They have two daughters, Georgina and Nuna. On the 8th of
February, 1899, Dr. Sullivan was again married, his second union being with
Mrs. Melvina Lemeaux, a native of Paris, France, who came to the United States
with her parents. She was educated at the Kankakee (Ill.) convent and after
marrying Peter Lemeaux settled in Day county in 1885. Her husband died in
Frankfort in 1898. Dr. Sullivan exercises his right of franchise in support of
the men and measures of the republican party and for four years filled the
office of county coroner while in Day county, while for two years he has occupied
the same position in Spink County. Fraternally he is connected with the
Independent Order of Odd Fellows, while along strictly professional lines he
has membership in the State Homeopathic Medical Association, of which he is
vice president, and the State Eclectic: Medical Association. He did not regard
his education as finished when he completed his university course but has since
remained a close student of the leading textbooks and medical journals and has
thus kept abreast of what is being done by the medical fraternity. His practice
has embodied the latest scientific principles and his labors have on the whole
been attended by success. </p>
