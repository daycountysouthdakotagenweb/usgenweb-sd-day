<p class=MsoNormal><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>EDWARD J. MURPHY,
the local representative of the Mississippi Lumber and Coal Company at Bristol,
Day county, was born in Washington county, Wisconsin, on the 29th of March,
1858, being a son of John and Bridget Murphy, who are now deceased. He attended
the public schools of his native county and as a youth learned the art of
telegraphy. At the age of twenty-one years he was given a position as telegraph
operator on the line of the Chicago, Milwaukee &amp; St. Paul Railroad in Iowa
and Minnesota, where he remained until the spring of 1883, when he was made
operator of this system at Summit, on the Sisseton Indian reservation in what
is now a part of South Dakota. He was thus identified with railroad work of
this nature in the employ of the company mentioned for a period of about seven
years, at various points in Iowa, Minnesota, North Dakota and South Dakota. In
1883 he took up a homestead claim in Valley township, Day county, this state,
and since that year has consecutively maintained his home in this county, being
one of its early settlers and one who is well known and highly esteemed in the
community. He proved up on his claim in due course of time, and still retains
the same in his possession, while he also has two other adjoining farms in the
county, all being located within a short distance of the village of Bristol,
where he has resided since 1901, having become the local agent of the
Mississippi Lumber and Coal Company at the time of its organization, in 1901,
and having ably and successfully managed its business here. He had previously given
his attention to farming and stock growing for a period of eight years. Mr.
Murphy was one of those prominently concerned in securing the incorporation of
the Day County Co-operative Creamery Association, of which he was secretary for
two years, the enterprise having proved very successful. In politics he
maintains an independent attitude, having followed the reform movement. In 1885
and 1886 he served as a member of the board of county commissioners, while he
has ever shown a deep interest in educational matters and in all else that has
tended to conserve the advancement and prosperity of the community, having held
various local and school offices. He has erected two houses in Bristol, and in
point of consecutive residence here he is now one of the oldest citizens, there
being but two or three others now here who had anticipated his location in the
village. He is a member of Andover Lodge, No. 115, Ancient Order of United
Workmen. In this county, in August, 1886, Mr. Murphy was united in marriage to Miss
Alice Larkin, who was born and reared in Green Lake county, Wisconsin, and they
have two children, Edward J. and Mary Alice. </p>
