WINFIELD PARLIMA</span></b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt'>N. The name of Parliman has figured prominently in connection with the
history of the legal profession in South Dakota for many years and has always
been a synonym for professional honor, enterprise and progress. He whose name
introduces this review is now successfully practicing in Sioux Falls in
partnership with his son and namesake, and the firm is regarded as one of the
strongest at the bar of South Dakota. He was born at Newton Falls, Ohio,
January 25, 1860, a son of Edwin and Jerusha Isabel (North) Parliman, who
became residents of Sioux Falls in the summer of 1877. The paternal
grandfather, Dr. William Parliman, was also a native of Ohio and for sixty-years
practiced medicine in Decorah, Iowa, where he passed away. He came of Holland
Dutch ancestry. Edwin Parliman, the father, was born in Stark county, Ohio,
December 12, 1832, and completed his education in Allegheny College at
Meadville, Pennsylvania, where he was graduated with the class of 1850, when he
was eighteen years of age. He was twenty-one years of age when he removed to
Decorah, Iowa, where he learned the watchmaker's trade, and in 1857 he became a
resident of Austin, Minnesota, where he continued until his removal to Hastings
in the same state. Wishing to turn from commercial to professional pursuits, he
took up the study of law and in 1860 was admitted to the bar, entering upon
active practice in Hastings, where he remained until 1862. Being unable to
longer content himself to remain at home while the preservation of the Union
was at stake, he offered his services to the government and was instrumental in
raising Company F of the Second Minnesota Cavalry in 1862. On the 31st of December
1863, he was commissioned first lieutenant of his company and on the 15th of May
1865, was promoted to the rank of captain, with which he served until mustered
out on the 2d of December, 1865, when he was brevetted major. His was a most
creditable military record, involving active duty against the Indians in the
west - a most arduous warfare because of the spirit and military methods of his
wily foes. After the close of the war Edwin Parliman resumed the practice of
law in Hastings and for four years he served as county attorney of Dakota
county, Minnesota. He remained in active practice in Hastings until 1877, when
he came to Sioux Falls, opened an office and prepared a home for his family who
followed in March, 1878. There he was appointed county attorney for Minnehaha County
by the county board and served for three years. He likewise was made city
attorney of Sioux Falls, and was the first incumbent in that office. He continued
in the active practice of his profession until 1890, when he was elected county
judge of Minnehaha County and remained upon the bench until January 1 1898,
baying been elected upon the republican ticker at each election after the
creation of South Dakota as a state until 1896, when he was defeated. He then
resumed the practice of law in partnership with Harry R. Carleton but later was
alone in his profession. When the new bankruptcy law went into effect he was
appointed referee in bankruptcy, which position he held until a short time
prior to his death, when the condition of his health forced him to resign and
he was succeeded by his son, Ralph W. Parliman, through appointment of Judge
Carland of the federal court. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

until January 1, 1890. He then removed to Webster, South Dakota, where he

and joined his father in a partnership that continued until the latter's death
on the 5th of June of that year. R. W. Parliman afterward practiced alone until
October 4, 1905, when he admitted his son, Ralph W. Jr., to a partnership that
still continues. The offices be has held have been largely in the strict path
of his profession. He was district attorney of Marshall County and in June

for two years. He was also a member of the school board at Webster, South
Dakota, for some years and in 1894 was appointed postmaster at that place by
President Cleveland, continuing in the office until July 1898. His military
record is that of quartermaster of Colonel Grigsby's Cowboy Regiment, the Third
United States Volunteer Cavalry, with which he served until the command was
mustered out at the close of the Spanish-American war. In politics he has
always been a republican, earnest and stalwart in support of the party. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
