<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>BERT
E. JOHNSON</span></b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>.
One of the well-known officials of Day County is Bert E. Johnson, of Webster, who
is serving as clerk of the court. He was born in Dodge County, Minnesota, July
28, 1878, and is a representative of one of the old families of that state, his
grandfather, Johannes Johnson, having settled there in pioneer times, after
which he was closely associated with agricultural pursuits. He had three sons
who served as soldiers in the Civil war, Louis, Andrew and Halvor. Another son,
Gunder H. Johnson, who became the father of Bert E. Johnson, was born in Norway
in 1844 and in his childhood was brought to the United States. He shared with
the family in the hardships and privations of frontier life, following the
establishment of the family home in Dodge County, Minnesota. He afterward
engaged in clerking in a store in Kansas for a number of years and is now
living in Webster, having retired from active business life. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>He
married Ida Haugen, who was born in Norway in 1853 and crossed the Atlantic in
her girlhood. They have become the parents of five children: Minnie, at home;
Bert E.; Martin C., who is traveling for a commission firm of Minneapolis;
Anna, the wife of George McLaughlin, of Eau Claire, Wisconsin; and Irene C., at
home. The parents are members of the Lutheran church and Mr. Johnson votes with
the Republican Party. Bert E. Johnson is indebted to the public schools of
Webster for his early educational privileges and he also pursued his studies
for a time in Olympia, Washington. He was reared to farm life, early becoming
familiar with the duties and labors that fall to the lot of the agriculturist
and when he started out on his own account he followed farming. Later he worked
at different occupations. He filled the position of clerk in a store, was
connected with the machinery business and also bought grain. In 1908 his fellow
citizens endorsed him for public office by electing him to the position of
clerk of the court and he has three times been reelected, making a most
creditable record in office by the prompt and faithful manner in which he
discharges his duties. He was the candidate of the republican party and he has
always been a loyal supporter of its principles. Fraternally he is connected
with the Knights of Pythias and he belongs to the Lutheran church. His life has
been guided by high and honorable principles and is the exemplification of a
noble, upright purpose. He turns to hunting and fishing for recreation but
allows no outside interests to interfere with the faithful performance of his
duties and that he has been a most efficient officer is manifest in the fact
that he has been four times chosen to the position which he now fills. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
