S. YEAGER</span></b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>
is treasurer of Day County, and is one of its well-known and most highly
esteemed citizens. He resides at the county seat, Webster. Mr. Yeager was born
in Iowa, December 25, 1857, and is a son of Leonard and Anna (Cunnington)
Yeager. Leonard Yeager, a native of Pennsylvania, spent the early years of his
life in Upper Canada. He soon afterward learned the carpenter's trade, at which
he worked for many years. In 1856 he took up his residence in Iowa, where he
remained until the fall of 1879. He then removed to Hubbard County, Minnesota,
where he now makes his home, living in retirement. He married our subject's
mother in Hamilton, Ontario, in the fall of 1855. Mrs. Yeager died in Hubbard,
Minnesota, on the 22d of December 1896. Silas received his education in the
schools of Iowa, and afterward worked as a farm laborer, devoting his entire
income until his twenty-fifth year to the support of the family. In June, 1880,
he removed with his parents to Hubbard county, Minnesota, securing employment
as a farm hand there. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>On
May 5, 1882, he settled in Day County, South Dakota, and shortly afterward
filed on a tree claim and homestead in Valley Township. He has since added to
his holdings, and is now the owner of seven hundred and twenty acres of fine
farming land. In May 1893, Mr. Yeager engaged in the coal and lumber business
at Bristol, in addition to farming. He sold the lumberyard on the 2nd of March
1894, but continued the coal business until December 6, i8~, when he also
disposed of that. He lived in Bristol from the 1st of October 1893, until the
time he sold out, and then removed to Webster to enter upon the duties of the
office of county treasurer. Mr. Yeager is a Populist in politics, and has been
an enthusiastic adherent of the principles of that party since its
organization, in which he assisted. Aside from the office, which he now
occupies, he has held many public positions in Day County. From 1892 to 1895 he
was one of the county commissioners. He has also served as school and township
treasurer, member of the school board, and so on. He is a member of the I. 0.
p. F. and the M. W. A.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>On
the 20th of November 1883, Mr. Yeager and Miss Rachel Buttler were married.
Mrs. Yeager is a native of Newton county, Indiana, and a daughter of Harrison
and Syntha Buttler. She went west with her parents to Douglas county,
Minnesota, when a child, and from the latter state removed to South Dakota in
1882, settling in Day county. Mr. and Mrs. Yeager are the parents of four
children: Floyd C.; Cora, deceased; Lilia, who died when an infant; and Glenn,
whose death occurred on the 17th of September 1897. Mr. Yeager has been one of
the most progressive agriculturists in Day County. He was a poor young man a
few years ago when he came to Dakota, but through his industry, pluck and able
management, he has gradually risen in the scale of fortune until he is now one
of the well-to-do men of that section. His career is a lesson, which may well
be taken to heart by those who complain of the hard lot which &quot;fate&quot;
has destined for them. Mr. Yeager had the same obstacles to overcome as most
men, and a great many more, as the Dakota pioneers will testify to a man
Instead of groaning about it, however, he went to work, and to-day he has in
full the reward of his exertions-a position in life, a competence for his
declining years, and the popularity which comes of honest success. The Dakota
of today would be still a wilderness had it not been for such men as these.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
