    <td><b>Potter, Daisy Herpel; Day County - 1883</b><p>First White Child Born 
    in Andover</p>
    <p>Written by Mrs. Potter in 1950</p>
    <p>First White Child Born In Andover Writes Of Her Early Day Experiences</p>
    <p>Father of Daisy Herpel Potter Overheard Minister Making Plans for his 
    Funeral</p>
    <p>My parents Mr. and Mrs. J.C. Herpel came to Andover from Michigan in the 
    fall of `82. After suffering several hemorrhages of the lungs, my father was 
    advised by physicians to seek a dryer climate, and like many others of that 
    time, went west in the hope of a cure. Still weak and sick upon arrival, he 
    was for some time confined to his bed in the hotel, and this story is told 
    of his experience there. His room in this hastily built structure, was 
    directly above the office, from which his constant coughing could be plainly 
    heard. One afternoon a group of men were sitting around the office. Upon 
    hearing the familiar coughing in the room above, the Doctor remarked, &quot;Well, 
    there's a man that came out here to die, and were going to have a funeral 
    here some of these days.&quot; &quot;And where shall we hold it?&quot; asked the minister.</p>
    <p>Different places were suggested, none of which seemed adequate, until it 
    was finally decided, at the suggestion of the section boss, that they hold 
    it in the depot, &quot;And do you know&quot;, remarked the lawyer, &quot;that we haven't a 
    cemetery&quot;. So they got out the plat of the town and laid out a place for the 
    cemetery. All of this time utterly unconscious of the fact that if they 
    could hear him cough, he could hear them talk, and as he later remarked, &quot;It 
    isn't often one has the opportunity of hearing his funeral so fully 
    discussed.&quot; At any rate the plans were laid aside, and to make a long story 
    short, or rather to make a short story long, for it did take a long time, he 
    got well, and still lives at the well seasoned age of 76, many years after 
    the Dr. and the lawyer and the minister have been laid to rest.</p>
    <p>Father did manage however to file on a claim in Union Township before 
    winter set in. I was born in town the following spring the first baby in 
    Andover.</p>
    <p>The story goes that some one asked &quot;Have you seen the new baby?&quot; &quot;Yes,&quot; 
    the other replied. &quot;She's a daisy&quot;, which of course was just a slang 
    expression of the day, and had no particular bearing on the case. However 
    some kind friend whose name is now lost in oblivion penned this little poem 
    which was printed in the Reporter and Farmer in March, 1883. After that the 
    folks thought it would be just the thing to name me Daisy Andover, and that 
    I was baptized. In later years this was something of a cross for me, though 
    I didn't say much about it, but I sort of envied the girls who had pretty 
    names like Flora Belle, and such, but after I heard of J. Pierpont Morgan, I 
    didn't feel so bad. Pierpont was the name of our nearest town.</p>
    <p>Daisy of Andover</p>
    <p>This morning there's joy in our little town,<br>
    This morn at the breaking of day,<br>
    For a wee little stranger had knocked at our gate, <br>
    And claims our permission to stay.</p>
    <p>Tis a sweet little woman, a wee little maid,<br>
    That has crept to our arms and our hearts,<br>
    And we gladly received her, and loved her at once,<br>
    And we hope she may never depart.</p>
    <p>Tis the first little babe that has come to our town.<br>
    And may life full of pleasure and grace,<br>
    Ever smile on our darling, our beautiful babe, <br>
    And bring joy to her sweet bonny face.</p>
    <p>And may the fleet years as they journey along, <br>
    Bring nothing but joy to the life,<br>
    Of Daisy of Andover, God's gift of love,<br>
    To our friends J.C. Herpel and wife.</p>
    <p>S.M.S.</p>
    <p>I remember having lived on the homestead as my parents moved later to a 
    preemption which they procured on the south edge of town. Here we resided 
    for many years. Our family consisting of Father, Mother, my sister Katha, 
    three years older than myself, my sister Eva, better known as Bobby, who was 
    two years younger than I, and myself.</p>
    <p>There was a fairly good sod shanty on the place south of town which the 
    folks later replaced with a frame house. As I look back over the years my 
    earliest recollections center about the sod house. It was papered in 
    newspapers but was later redone in real wallpaper with lovely blue roses on 
    it. One end of the main room was fixed up for a bed room, and the other for 
    a kitchen. There was also a lean-to on the west where we girls slept, three 
    in a bed. Another lean-to on the east, served as back shed and summer 
    kitchen. We also enjoyed a splendid well of water that came nearly to the 
    top of the ground.</p>
    <p>We girls walked back and forth to school in town, which then consisted of 
    a wooden structure with one room upstairs and another down. The children I 
    remember in the lower room were Lena and Willie Fortune, Jim and Agnes 
    Murray, Nell and Dennis Sullivan, Nina and Eva Wilson, Al and Hattie Marske, 
    the Rynan girls, Walter and Thel Griffith, May Gillolly, Lily Easterby, 
    Leila Webster, Bennie and Bessie Mayo, Harry and Kitten Dixon, Roy and 
    Lizzie Moore, Susy Tice, Marion Lewis, Will Collier, Raymond Fortune, the La 
    Cherne girls, Mary Knudson, and August Blaedorn. The first teacher I 
    remember was Ola Stafford and the next was Miss Walsh.</p>
    <p>The artesian well which was one of the finest in the state, clear as 
    crystal water very soft and about 70o, was a matter of considerable pride to 
    the little village of Andover, especially since Groton had a muddy one. For 
    besides supplying the town, the overflow was piped out to the end of Main 
    street into a large artificial lake. The fountain that fed this was a 
    constant delight to us children, we loved to watch it throw its stream of 
    crystal water 15 or 20 feet in the air, running day and night, winter and 
    summer. The lake was supplied with several row boats which afforded many an 
    evening's enjoyment for the young people round about. Skating was enjoyed in 
    the winter.</p>
    <p>The powerful water pressure afforded fire protection also, the hose 
    throwing water to the top of the highest elevator. I remember one day they 
    were trying out the fire hose on Main street, then one of the men took it to 
    flush off the side walk in front of his place of business. Another man came 
    along, he was dressed in the latest fashion of that time. They had some 
    disagreement, one hasty word followed another, the man with the hose turned 
    it directly on the other. Bystanders fled to cover, I ducked into Bob 
    Martyn's tailor shop from which point of vantage, I was an eye witness to 
    this juicy bit of scandal, and can remember yet the half drowned man 
    standing there, the water gushing in rivers from the beautifully tailored 
    legs. I often think how well the men dressed in those days and can well 
    remember Mr. Stickles, Ed Bryant, J. G. Wilson, A. E. Raynes, whom I thought 
    particularly handsome, as well as my own father, coming down the teetery 
    board sidewalk to church of a Sunday morning dressed in Prince Albert coats, 
    high silk hats, gray trousers, kid gloves and walking sticks.</p>
    <p>The Methodist Church was the same as it is now though improvements have 
    been made from time to time. I believe previous to its erection, services 
    were held in the homes and later in Mill's hall. Among the early day 
    ministers I can remember were Rev. Ware, Dr. Carson, Rev. Warren, Rev. 
    Clatworthy, and later Rev. Millet who came from England, and served our 
    church and the one at Pierpont for so many years, and who filled so 
    important a place in the lives of the young people of both communities was 
    responsible for the sending of many of our young people to college.</p>
    <p>The Catholic Church was the same building or a part of what it is now for 
    it was later moved back and added onto. Father Mensing was the only priest I 
    remember in the early days, and how fond he was of children, and when he 
    came to town how we all flocked around him and many a good frolic we had.</p>
    <p>I remember some woman being in charge of the Methodist Sunday School, 
    perhaps it was Mrs. Ware, at any rate she was later replaced by Mrs. 
    Carpenter who held that office for so many years. Who could ever forget the 
    annual Sunday School picnic often held at Lynn Lake? I noticed in the paper 
    just the other day that the Seniors of the Andover High School went out for 
    a little outing. They stopped off at Lake Kampeska, from there they went to 
    Aberdeen and took in a show. I wonder what they would think of sitting on 
    boards across the box of a lumber wagon, in the broiling sun behind a slow 
    team, over grass roads headed for Lynn Lake, for their only picnic of the 
    year.</p>
    <p>Yet how eagerly we looked forward to this important event. After scarcely 
    sleeping the night before in excited anticipation, we rose early the next 
    morning, fed and watered the calves and chickens, picketed out the cows, and 
    left everything in as good shape as possible. Finished packing the lunches, 
    then for a good scrub, and braid up the pig tails for each other, and don 
    the brand new pink sunbonnets, and join the train of wagons headed for the 
    cool and shady shores of Lynn Lake. I can still remember how stiff and tired 
    we got, and oh, so hungry after our early and hurried breakfast. But when we 
    piled out of these hot and dusty wagons, into the long cool grass under 
    those lovely trees, it seemed that Heaven itself could hold no added joy.</p>
    <p>How we scampered about, while the men carried water and the women 
    unpacked the lunches, and made the lemonade, that inevitable accompaniment 
    to every well regulated picnic. Meanwhile Mr. Carpenter got out the big coil 
    of rope he always brought along, and soon had several fine swings in working 
    order. While this was going on Ed Putman the town bachelor and descendant of 
    the famous Israel of Revolutionary days, got busy with his sharp and trusty 
    jack knife, and made willow whistles for all the boys and girls. In fact he 
    never let up till every child had one. When the call to dinner came, how we 
    fell to, and such an array of goodies. After eating our fill, then came the 
    long afternoon of swinging, games, and frolicking under those wonderful 
    trees, for we simply had none at home, remember. Then another lunch, the 
    horses were watered and hitched, and next came the long trek home in the 
    cool of the evening. How hard it was to stay awake on those hard boards 
    after such a strenuous day. Then home again unloading in the dark, a few 
    hasty chores by lantern light and bed time again. Such was the Sunday School 
    picnic of the early days.</p>
    <p>The first funeral I really remember, was that of little Ada Johnson, six 
    year old daughter and only child of Mr. and Mrs. Art Johnson. &quot;And we wept 
    that one so lovely should have had a life so brief&quot;, for she was such a 
    sweet little thing, with beautiful golden curls as entrancing as any 
    Goldilocks of story book fame. Ever after that, young as I was, my heart 
    went out to those sorrowing ones who laid their loved ones away, in that 
    barren wind-swept spot, the cemetery that was platted out, you remember. It 
    was but a little ways, and in full view of our house, perhaps it was a baby, 
    or some poor mother, who had given up her life that another might live, or 
    maybe the father of a family, who left his little brood, strangers in a 
    strange land; we children would steal over the next day and smooth down the 
    yellow clay, as best we could, outline the grave with rocks, or perhaps 
    ornament it with a cross or heart done in pretty pebbles, or make a wreath 
    of flowers, those yellow ones so common on the prairies.</p>
    <p>The first prairie fire I remember was when I was about six and was not an 
    important one but gave us something of a scare. My little sister was playing 
    with her dolls in the back kitchen when she called, &quot;Mama see the pretty, 
    pretty&quot;. Mother was busy in the other room, and thinking it was only her 
    doll, she said, &quot;yes, that's nice.&quot; But she persisted and finally said, 
    &quot;Mama come see the pretty, pretty right now.&quot; So she dropped her work and 
    came at once. To her surprise she saw the fire, some little distance off but 
    coming right that way. It was early spring and there was a bare potato patch 
    just south of the house, which sat on slightly rising ground concealing the 
    fire from view of the town. Seizing her sunbonnet, as Father was away, and 
    charging us not to leave the house till she got back, she ran all the way to 
    town, and spread the alarm. Soon about twenty men were on the scene. Each 
    had taken a new broom from Wilson's store and dipped it in the lake as they 
    passed by and rushed on to beat out the fire. I think some neighbor plowed a 
    furrow with a walking plow. We watched them straggling back several hours 
    later tired and smoked up, their brooms burnt black, the fire out.</p>
    <p>The first wedding that it was my privilege to witness was that of my aunt 
    Miss Anna Ellis to Louis J. Gower. This was solemnized in the new house, 
    which had been embellished with new ingrain carpet in the parlor and best 
    bed room, new curtains and sofa, a fine Art Garland stove and an oak center 
    table with two shelves for the albums. The guests included but a few 
    intimate friends and as we had no relatives here the company was a small 
    one. How sweet and womanly my aunt looked, in her well fitting gown of brown 
    taffeta with the cream silk lace at the throat. Why did they all weep, and 
    the supper, that was the main thing I thought.</p>
    <p>The first Christmas I can remember was in the old Mills hall, but before 
    that they had them in the depot. There was a big tree loaded with pretty 
    things. My sister and I each got a bottle of Hoight's German Cologne and a 
    big doll with a china head, and as well set a permanent as one would wish to 
    see. Subsequent Christmases, mostly in the Methodist Church were equally 
    delightful. I don't think we ever missed one no matter how deep the snow or 
    how cold the night, Father saw to that. Snuggled down in the hay in the home 
    made sleigh with plenty of blankets and the old buffalo robe the short 
    distance we had to go took but a few minutes, and the effort was well 
    repaid.</p>
    <p>The first blizzard I remember was the famous one of `88. We were still 
    living in the sod and I distinctly recall that a friend who batched it on a 
    claim many miles to the south stopped with us when the storm came on. He and 
    Father took down the clothes line and tied it about the waist of one of 
    them, while the other held the end of it at the back door. Thus they brought 
    in coal and water and did the chores, making things snug and tight. I even 
    remember them pouring many pails of water over the shanty roof, where it 
    froze in an icy sheet that kept out the bitter wind as well as snow that 
    might have sifted in. We could scarcely tell when the storm was over as the 
    snow was packed completely over the sod shanty so that every window was a 
    blank wall. When the wind finally went down, the next day I suppose, they 
    opened up the back door which luckily opened in, and there was the pattern 
    of the door in the snow clear to the top, a neat white wall. After filling 
    the wash boiler and tubs with snow, the men cut steps up and out for the 
    snow was so hard it would hold up the weight of a man or even a horse. The 
    bright sun on the white world was simply dazzling.</p>
    <p>Another thing I remember so well was the barrels of apples that came from 
    Michigan, what bright spots they were in a fruitless land. First the letter 
    saying that one had been sent, then the weeks of waiting till the happy day 
    arrived, when Father brought it home from the depot. How we gathered around 
    when it was opened, oh, how good it smelled. If Grandma Herpel sent it, in 
    the top would be a big package of home knit stockings and mittens. What a 
    world of work they must have been! No one was forgotten, each was a size 
    larger that the year before. Then farther down in the barrel was the usual 
    flour sack of home dried apples for pies, and in the bottom the sack of 
    black walnuts. If it were from Grandma Ellis, stowed away in the middle was 
    a can of maple sugar, and a sack of butternuts or perhaps a stone jar of 
    apple butter or blackberry jam sealed tight with rosin and beeswax. And the 
    apples, how good they tasted, the greasy Pippins, the golden Bell Flower, 
    the Rambos, the Northern Spys, and the Tolman Sweets. How good these mothers 
    were to go to all this work for us. One a foster mother, the other a step 
    mother with a large brood of her own still at home, for both our parents had 
    lost their mothers at an early age.</p>
    <p>Though we never suffered the real privations that fell the lot of some, I 
    often marvelled later that Mother always found the money somewhere, for a 
    few good books and the best of magazines and always the daily paper from 
    Chicago or Minneapolis. Many a Sunday afternoon she spent reading aloud to 
    the family, and Father realizing our restrictions and being an orphan in his 
    childhood, was so good to take us with him whenever he could and 
    painstakingly showed us many points of interest. I ever remember his taking 
    me to Minneapolis on a business trip when I was only four and I still recall 
    many things that happened, perhaps because we were blockaded and spent two 
    weeks on the train. I was the only child along and came in for lots of 
    attention, and no doubt came back badly spoiled. Another time he took my 
    sister and me to Michigan to visit at the old home and treated us to several 
    days of sightseeing in Minneapolis and Chicago. We were seven and nine then.</p>
    <p>A narration of this sort would be incomplete without a reference to our 
    pony, a red and white spotted bronco named Dan, and a real cow pony of the 
    old school, having been trained on a big cattle ranch out west. At any rate 
    he certainly knew his stuff, and his splendid training often made up for my 
    inexperience. To really do him justice would nearly take a book. He could be 
    guided by merely a hand on his neck, or simply leaning to the side, and 
    leave it to him to head a cow for home. He could round up a bunch of cattle 
    and take them out to feed with no one on his back, indeed I often saw him do 
    it. I was only five when Reuben Stewart taught me how to ride. My older 
    sister was never very strong and did not care to ride and my younger was too 
    small and did not ride till later. It always fell my lot to be the cow boy 
    of the family and do all the errands, even some for the neighbors, for there 
    were no cars or phones. I'm sure old settlers remember me best in my yellow 
    sunbonnet, tearing down the road on his back, chasing off stray stock, or on 
    another jaunt after old Mrs. Schrader's cow that would run off while she was 
    away washing.</p>
    <p>I often wonder what life would have been to me in the early days without 
    that horse, for I fairly grew up with him. Years later when I had been gone 
    for over a year and returned to the old home, the first thing I did was to 
    go down in the pasture in search of him. As soon as he saw me coming he let 
    out a long piercing whinny rushed up and nuzzled his nose against my neck. 
    He knew me and his welcome was complete. Could Fred Thompson have been any 
    prouder of Silver King?</p>
    <p>So as I pen these lines, it all comes back to me. I can see the miles of 
    rolling prairie, a treeless plain, the soft green hills to the south and 
    east, often scarred by prairie fires, the whirlwind, the mirages in the 
    quivering heat, the scattered claim shacks, the oxen and the new turned sod.</p>
    <p>I remember the trials that fell the lot of the early settler, the 
    scorching wind, the prairie fire, the blizzard and the hail, each one a 
    story in itself. Then came the wheat, how bright and green it looked on the 
    nice clean sod, how beautifully it waved, changing color in the summer sun. 
    How rich and golden in the autumn haze, and what possibilities it possessed. 
    The new top buggy, a fur coat for Father which he needed badly, an organ for 
    the parlor, and perhaps, yea perhaps, that long hoped for trip back home.</p>
    <p>These and many more are the memories of a little girl.</p>
