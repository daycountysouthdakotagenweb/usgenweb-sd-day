<p class=MsoNormal>GEORGE A. BENNETT. Business enterprise and progress in
Bristol are attributable in no small measure to the efforts of George A.
Bennett, a well known merchant and the president of the First National Bank of
the town. With him a recognition of opportunity has ever marked the path of
advancement. He was born in Cleveland, Ohio, January 12, 1864, a son of George
and Jane (Tregilius) Bennett. The father, who was born in Pennsylvania in 1821,
was married in the state of New York to Miss Janes Tregilius, a native of
England, born in 1836. Soon afterward they removed to Ohio and for five years
were residents of Cleveland, going thence to Iowa in 1864. There the father
purchased land and carried on farming until his death, which occurred in 1896.
His widow still survives, being now in the eightieth year of her age. To them
were born ten children, six of whom are yet living, namely: J. W., a retired
druggist living in Janesville, Iowa; George A., of this review; Mrs. John
Carey, whose husband is a farmer living in Waverly, Iowa; Everett S., of
Bristol, who is associated with his brother George in the mercantile business;
Mrs. A C. Clewell, whose husband is engaged in the real-estate business at
Watonga, Oklahoma; and Elmer R., who conducts a transfer company at Pierre,
South Dakota. Both Mr. and Mrs. Bennett were earnest Christian people, the
former holding membership in the Methodist Episcopal and the latter in the
Episcopal church. In politics he was a republican and at all times he met the
obligations of public as well as of private life. George A. Bennett was
educated in the common schools of Iowa and started on his business career in
connection with the drug trade. Later he turned his attention to general
merchandising and has since been active in that field. In 1882 he removed to
Dakota territory and since 1885 he has been one of the enterprising merchants
of Bristol, having a well appointed store and carrying a large and carefully
selected stock. His courteous treatment of his patrons and his honest dealing
have also been elements in his growing success. He devotes most of his time to
his mercantile business but he is also the president of the First National
Bank, which is capitalized for twenty-five thousand dollars, has surplus and
undivided profits amounting to seven thousand dollars and average deposits of
two hundred thousand dollars. He is also the owner of farm land-and all this in
the face of the fact that he came to the west a poor boy dependent entirely
upon his own resources. The first marriage ceremony performed in Bristol was
that of George A. Bennett and Emma F. Ross, who were joined in wedlock in 1886.
The latter is a native of Mower county, Minnesota, and a daughter of Joseph
Ross, an early agriculturist and civil engineer of that state. To our subject
and his wife have been born five children, four of whom survive, as follows:
Maude, the first female child born in Bristol; Olive M., the wife of Allen
Baker, who is engaged in the restaurant and real-estate business at Manhattan,
Montana; and Cora M. and Charles, both at home. The parents are members of the
Episcopal church, in which they take an active and helpful part, Mr. Bennett
serving now as warden. He belongs to the Odd Fellows lodge and Woodmen camp and
in politics is independent, but is not remiss in the duties of citizenship and
has served on the town and school boards. He is ever willing to aid in measures
and movements for the public good and has cooperated heartily in many plans for
the upbuilding of Bristol, while at the same time he has carefully conducted
his business affairs and through the legitimate lines of trade has gained substantial
and well merited success. </p>
