Ingeborg Sigdestad was born on July 23, 1856

in Opstryn, Nordfjord, Norwey — parents Sakarias and Synneve Sigdestad. She

emigrated with her parents, one sister, and three brothers, arriving in

Montevideo, Minn, the spring of 1881.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p>



On January 4, 1882, she was married to Iver

Skaare at Granite Falls, Minnesota. Here I’ll mention an interesting feature

about the ceremony. A Lutheran Pastor could not be found and as love could not

wait, a Justice of the. Peace performed the ceremony with all dignity, in the English

language, entirely foreign to the bride and groom, but in all good faith the

Service was accepted and proved binding. In later years I well remember Aunt

Ingeborg mention this fact about their marriage ceremony in a language they did

not understand, with a great deal of humor. Their wedding gifts were a second

hand coffee pot, a pair of used flat irons.

<p>



They lived in Yellow <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:

italic'>Medicine County</span> until the spring of 1884 when they too developed

the fever to move to new regions—with their possessions in a covered wagon and

team of oxen, one cow, 2 roosters and one hen, and few household utensils set

their course for Dakota.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>After a

journey of ten days with their 10 month old baby, they came to Lynn Twp and

stayed for a while in a dugout on the land owned by Alfred Tofley near Lynn

Lake. Later they located their clam five miles west of Lynn Lake. They were the

first settlers to the community — their first home was a shack 12 x 14 feet,

the outside sod and inside rough boards. This served as parlor, bed­room, dining

and kitchen and even accommodated strangers seeking homes on the prairie.



<p>



Mrs. Skaare and baby spent the first summer

alone while her husband went back to Minnesota to work, so a little extra money

could <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>­</i>be earned to tide them over

winter. Theses were lonely days for Mrs. Skaare and many tears were shed. They

were fortunate in not being molested by Indians - they were scarce, but the

prairie fires were a constant worry. The early settlers life was many

hardships, but with good health, willing hands and staunch faith in God, they

progressed.



<p>To this union were born ten children — 6

girls and 4 sons:



<OL><LI>

Emma - Mrs. G. N. Holden</LI>



<LI>

Serine — Mrs. L. T. Mydland </LI>



<LI>Clara — Mrs. George Erdahl</LI>



<LI>Ida — Mrs. J. Fossum</LI>



<LI>Emily — Mrs. Carl Brandlee</LI>



<LI>Agnes — Mrs. Lars Larson</LI>



<LI>Edwin, John, Elmer, Sivert (who passed away

at the age of 27 years.</LI>





</OL>

<p> Mr. and Mrs. Skaare were the organizers of

Bergen congregation intensely interested in schools and religious instruction

for their children and decent community living.</p>



<P>The Skaars enjoyed life together for 56

years. On Jan 4, 1932, their relatives and friends of Bergen congregation feted

their Golden wedding Anniversary.</p>



<P>Mrs. Skaare spent all her life on the

homestead she labored to establish and passed away on July 15, 1943, age 86, and

burial was in the Bergen Ch. Her husband preceded her death by 2 veers.</p>
