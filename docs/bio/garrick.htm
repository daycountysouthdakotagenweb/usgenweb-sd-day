<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>JAMES
C. GARRICK</span></b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>,
of Webster, filling the office of sheriff of Day County, was born in Delhi, New
York, December 20, 1872, a son of Alex and Elizabeth (Cowan) Garrick, who were
natives of Delaware county, New York, born in 1845 and 1843 respectively. The
father is still living but the mother passed away in 1909. They were married in
the Empire State and in 1880 removed to Iowa, where the father secured a farm
and in 1883 they became residents of Faulk County, South Dakota, where he took
up land from the government. After cultivating that tract for a time he removed
to the vicinity of Faulkton and at the present time is living retired, making
his home with his children. His business affairs were carefully and wisely
conducted, bringing him success. His family numbered five children, of whom
four are living: Isabella, the wife of William Plants, a merchant and farmer
living near Faulkton; W. R., who is sheriff of Faulk county; A. A., manager for
the Day County Garage Company; and James C. The father is a member of the
Congregational church and an active representative of the Independent Order of
Odd Fellows. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>In
politics he is a republican and for several years served as county commissioner
of Faulk County. His father, Alex Garrick, Sr., was born in Scotland and at the
age of seventeen years came to the United States. He followed the occupation of
farming and died in the state of New York. The maternal grandfather of James C.
Garrick was Andrew Cowan, who was born in Scotland, and also engaged in
agricultural pursuits to the time of his demise, which occurred in New York.
James C. Garrick after acquiring a common-school education turned his attention
to farming and to the grain business and since starting out independently has
made steady progress. He has an interest in the firm of Potter, Garrick &amp;
Potter, which controls a line of nine elevators at various points in this state
and they handle an extensive amount of grain, their business furnishing an
excellent market for the grain raisers, while at the same time it is a source
of profitable income to the partners. Believing in South Dakota and its future,
Mr. Garrick has invested to a large extent in land in this state and is also
the owner of land in North Dakota.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>In
1902 occurred the marriage of Mr. Garrick and Miss Evelyn Potter, a daughter of
S. L. Potter, of Webster, South Dakota, and they have one child, Carlyle, born
in 1906. The parents occupy an enviable social position and are regarded as
devout members of the Congregational church. In Masonry Mr. Garrick has taken
the degrees of the Scottish Rite and of the Mystic Shrine. His political
allegiance is given to the republican party and he has served as alderman of
Webster, while in 1912 he was elected to the office of sheriff of Day county,
in which he is making a most creditable record by the prompt, fearless and
faithful discharge of his duties. He represents one of the old pioneer families
of his section of the state and has for about a third of a century been
identified with the progress and development of this part of South Dakota. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
