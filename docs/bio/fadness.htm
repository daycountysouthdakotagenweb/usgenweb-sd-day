    Mrs. A. E. Halverson 1958</p>
    <p>History of Mrs. Inga Otelia Snipstad Fadness</p>
    <p>Mrs. Fadness was born Dec. 27, 1864 at Oslo, Norway of parents Eric and 
    Karina Snipstad. She received her schooling and grew to young womanhood in 
    Oslo. Inga came to Day County, Dakota Territory in July 1887. Arriving in 
    Bristol, Tom Strandness was the first to meet her. She came to her brothers 
    Louie and Ole Snipstad, where she kept house for them until March of 1888. 
    In that year she was married to Ole G. Fadness.</p>
    <p>They made their home on a farm in Scotland township. Their first house 
    was a dugout in a sunny hillside, with only one room, a door and one window. 
    Undaunted by circumstances, she white washed the dirt walls and it became a 
    home, though humble.</p>
    <p>After about four years they moved to a four room frame house which they 
    built about a mile from the first home. This was in Oak Gulch township.</p>
    <p>Six children were born to this union. Mrs. Fadness went through the 
    hardships of Pioneer life. Drought and grasshoppers took their crops some of 
    those early years. Prairie fires were very common. At one of these times she 
    and her children carried water and kept the walls of the fire side of the 
    house wet. She even used her big crocks of milk for this purpose. Her 
    husband was out fighting fires away from home. The house was saved this time 
    too.</p>
    <p>Typhoid fever laid her low for weeks. Drs. were few and far away. She had 
    an undaunted spirit and faith in God sustained her.</p>
    <p>She and her husband joined with other neighbors and met for worship once 
    a month in a schoolhouse six miles away. This was a nucleus served by 
    pastors form the United Lutheran Church in the Aberdeen circuit.</p>
    <p>Mrs. Fadness lived on the farm for 11 years after her husband passed away 
    except for the winter months when she lived with her daughter Mrs. Albert 
    Herr (Marmien). The summer months were spent in her little new house on the 
    original homestead run by her son Elmer until she passed away of a stroke in 
    September of 1947.</p>
    <p>Compiled by her daughter Carrie, Mrs. A. E. Halverson, Butler, South 
    Dakota</p>
    <p>Blessed is Mother’s memory to all of us children.</p>
