<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>ALBERT
C. BIERNATZKI, a prominent and successful member of the bar of McCook County
being actively engaged in the practice of his profession in Salem, was born in
Webster City, Iowa, on the 3d of December, 1860, being a son of Charles and
Margaret (Noland) Biernatzki, the former of whom was born in Poland and the
latter in Ireland. The father of our subject was reared to maturity in his
native land, and secured his educational training in the military academy in
St. Petersburg. He was thereafter commissioned a colonel in the Russian army,
but as his mother was strenuously opposed to his continuing in the military
service he resigned his office and was appointed a member of the government
engineering corps, with the rank of colonel. He became involved in the
revolution of 1847, manifesting that distinctive loyalty which was one of his
dominating characteristics, and his patriotism placed his life in jeopardy, so
that in that year he left his native land and came to America, locating in
Oswego, New York, where he became identified with the shipping trade, owning
and operating two or more vessels. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>In
1857 he removed to Webster City, Iowa, where he engaged in farming and
live-stock enterprises, becoming one of the prominent and influential citizens
of that section and being signally prospered in his business operations. He
died in 1899, at the venerable age of eighty-two years, honored by all who knew
him and recognized as a man of fine intellectuality and sterling character. He
was a stanch Republican, and while never ambitious for office he was an
influential factor in the councils of his party. His wife is still living.
Albert C. Biernatzki secured his early educational discipline in the public
schools of his native place and then entered the University of Des Moines,
Iowa, where he continued his studies for two years, while in 1881, he was
matriculated in the Iowa State University, at Iowa City, where he had
simultaneously prosecuted a technical course in the law department of the
university, in which he was graduated in 1884, with the degree of Bachelor of
Laws. In March of the following year he took up his residence in Salem, South
Dakota, being one of the early members of the bar of the county, and here he
has ever since been established in the active practice of his profession,
having built up an excellent business and retaining a representative clientage,
while he has high standing at the bar of the state. He continued to be a close
and appreciative student, and is considered one of the best read lawyers in
this section. He is a stalwart advocate of the principles and policies of the
Republican party, in whose cause he has been an effective worker, and he served
as county judge from 1889 until 1903, with the exception of one term, his
rulings being signally impartial, indicating not only the possession of an
intrinsically judicial mind but also a wide and intimate knowledge of the
science of jurisprudence. The Judge is a member of Fortitude Lodge, No. 72,
Free and Accepted Masons; Salem Chapter, No. 34, Royal Arch Masons; Constantine
Commandery, No. 17, Knights Templar, and El Riad Temple of the Ancient Arabic
Order of the Nobles of the Mystic Shrine, at Sioux Falls. On the 7th of June,
1887, was solemnized the marriage of Judge Biernatzki to Miss Emma Sibley, of
State Center, Iowa, and they are the parents of one son and two daughters,
Charles, Margaret and Helen. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
