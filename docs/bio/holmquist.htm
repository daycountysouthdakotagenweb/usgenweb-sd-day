<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>HON.
PETER HOLMQUIST</span></b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt'>, whose portrait appears on another page, resides on section 22, Kidder
Township. He is one of Day County’s pioneers and a successful and popular
agriculturist. Mr. Holmquist was born in the southern part of Sweden, June 27,
1847, and is a son of John Isaacson and Martha Peterson, both natives of Sweden,
where they still reside. John Isaacson is a farmer by occupation, and the
father of four children, three sons and a daughter. Our subject, who is the
only one living in this country, was compelled to assist on the farm when very
young, and received little or no schooling, all his education having been
picked up at various times since. He has, however, improved his opportunities
wonderfully, and upon the principle that a thing which is hardest gained is
best kept; is to-day a more accomplished man than many of his fellows who have
spent years over the books. When nineteen years of age Mr. Holmquist came to
this country, settling in Stillwater, Minnesota. He remained there for nine
years, engaged in river driving and work in the neighboring woods. In 1875 he
returned to Sweden on a visit, staying there four years. When he came back to
the United States he brought a company of his friends to the number of thirty,
all intent upon getting homes in the great west. The party went directly to
Dakota and secured homesteads in Kidder Township, Day County. Mr. Holmquist
himself filed upon a pre-emption and tree claim, where he has since made his
home, He improved his land, added buildings, barns, granaries, etc., and by
hard and energetic work succeeded in making one of the best farms in the county
- for this much is admitted by all to-day. He is now the owner of eight hundred
acres of land, half of which is under the plow and yielding excellent crops
each year. In 1896 Mr. Holmquist's barn and granary were destroyed by a
cyclone, and he at the same time lost four horses and other stock. The damage
was speedily repaired, however, and the razed structures rebuilt in a short
time, and the place presents even a more attractive appearance at the present
time than ever before. Mr. Holmquist is independent in politics. In 1894 he was
elected a member of the legislature on the People's party ticket, serving two
years. He enjoys the distinction of having helped to organize the county and
township, as, at the time of his arrival, in 1882, things were in a very
chaotic state, and there was little or no local government to speak of. Mr.
Holmquist has been a township officer every year since the organization of the
township, and is at present a member of the school board and a township
supervisor, having served as chairman of the former continuously since the
organization of the district. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>In
1878 our subject married Miss Ellen Johnson, in Sweden. Mr. and Mrs. Holmquist
are the parents of four children: Herman, Albert A., Ida C. and Ann 0. Three of
them are now attending high school at Webster, South Dakota. Mr. Holmquist and
family are members of the Lutheran mission, Friends' church.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
