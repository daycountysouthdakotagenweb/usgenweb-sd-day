Waubay and has other important business and financial connections, showing him
to be resourceful, enterprising and progressive. He was born in Fillmore County,
Minnesota, and is a son of Z. D. and Roxanna (Lund) Lasell. The father was born
in Canada in 1831, a son of Thomas Lasell, a native of Vermont, who, however,
died in Canada, where he had practiced medicine for many years, being an active
physician and surgeon. The mother, a native of New York state, was born in
1833. Her father, Silas Lund, was a native of Vermont. He devoted his life to farming
and died in Kansas. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

to Miss Roxanna Lund, and in 1856 they removed westward to Minnesota, where he
preempted land in Fillmore County. He was one of the pioneer residents of that
district and aided in the work of development and improvement in frontier days.
In fact, he continued his farming interests there until 1892, when he removed
to Waubay, South Dakota. He homesteaded land in this state, where he continued
to reside until he went to California on a visit and there passed away. He was
a consistent Christian gentleman, holding membership in the Methodist Episcopal
church and took an active part in all branches of its work. He departed this
life May 28, 1912, and his wife died April 16, 1900. Their family numbered nine
children, of whom eight are living: Loena, the wife of W. C. Paddock, a
blacksmith of Eureka, California; Julia, the wife of George W. Dilley, a
railroad man living at Portland, Oregon; Silas Thomas; Bertha, who married W.
F. Osborn, a farmer of Canada; Dana A., a retired farmer living in Waubay;
George G., who is proprietor of a store at Millerton, North Dakota; Hattie,
deceased; M. C., an attorney of Aberdeen, South Dakota; and Mabel, living at
Vona, Colorado. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Valley, Minnesota, completing a high-school course by graduation with the class
of 1878. His early business training was that of the farm and he became
thoroughly acquainted with every phase of farm work. Removing to South Dakota,
he homesteaded land, which he still owns, having now a half section of the
homestead place in addition to much other land in which he has invested. He
started out in life on his own account when twenty-one years of age and as time
has passed has prospered largely owing to his judicious investments. He is
numbered among the prominent business men of Waubay, being president of the
State Bank, which is capitalized for fifteen thousand dollars and which has a
surplus of three thousand dollars and average deposits of one hundred and fifty
thousand dollars. He also has important interests in elevator and in electric
light plants and other business projects and devotes much of his time to his
farming interests, which are extensive and important. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Iowa and they had three children but only one is now living, Sylvan, who was
born December 27, 1908; Ithiel and Nellie are deceased. Both Mr. and Mrs.
Lasell adhere to the Christian faith. He is a member of the United Brethren
church, while she is a Lutheran. He takes an advanced stand upon many questions
of vital interest, being a stanch temperance worker and a supporter of the Prohibition
Party. He has held some township offices and at all points in his career has
been loyal to the public welfare, while at the same time he has promoted his individual
interests. One of the important factors in his growing success is his ability
to recognize and improve opportunities which others pass heedlessly by. He
seems at once to become cognizant of the value of a business situation and his
sound judgment and industry have constituted an impetus for the successful
conduct of various important business concerns. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
