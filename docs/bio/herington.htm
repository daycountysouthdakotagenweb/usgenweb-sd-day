Waubay, was born in Jackson, Michigan, December 7, 1859, a son of Pulaski N. and
Elizabeth (Brewer) Herington. The paternal grandfather, Irwin Herington, was a
native of New York, devoted his entire life to farming and passed away in
Michigan. The maternal grandfather, Samuel Brewer, was born in England, came to
the United States in 1847 and settled in Jackson county, Michigan, where he
carried on general agricultural pursuits, living on the old homestead to the
time of his death, which occurred when he had reached the venerable age of
ninety-two years. The father was born in the state of New York in 1834 and his
life record covered the intervening years to 1904. His wife, who was born in England
in 1839, passed away in the year 1902. They were married in Jackson, Michigan,
where Mr. Herington had located when twenty years of age, accompanying his
parents to that place. He had acquired a district school education and he
turned his attention to farming, purchasing land which he occupied and
cultivated until 1858. He then purchased other land, on which his remaining
days were spent. He was a self-made man, enterprise and industry constituting
his salient characteristics.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

this state; S. O., a retired agriculturist who makes his home in Moscow, Idaho;

native city B. F. Herington acquired his preliminary education and afterward
pursued a business course. He started out in life as a salesman for a grain
company in South Dakota, to which state he came in 1883, and subsequently
engaged in the grain business on his own account at Waubay, where he located in
1889. For fifteen years he was active in the grain trade, meeting with substantial
success, after which he turned his attention to banking, purchasing the
controlling interest in the First National Bank of Waubay in 1904, in which
year he became president. It is capitalized for twenty five thousand dollars,
has surplus and undivided profits of fifteen thousand and average deposits of
two hundred and twenty-five thousand. The bank has enjoyed a healthful growth
and is in excellent condition, a general banking business being conducted,
while a liberal patronage is accorded the institution. Mr. Herington's high

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>banking circles is indicated
by the fact that in 1914 he was elected president of group five of the National
Bankers of the State of South Dakota. In addition to his activities as a banker
he handles real estate and farm loans and is himself the owner of one thousand
acres of fine land. The proud American title of a self-made man is his by right
of his industry, determination and perseverance, for those qualities have
advanced him from a humble financial position to a place of prominence in the
business circles of his adopted county. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

children, as follows: Guy, who is employed in his father's bank; Hazel, who has
completed her education; and Harold, who is attending school. The wife and
mother died in 1902, passing away in the faith of the Methodist Episcopal
church, of which she was a devoted member. In 1905 Mr. Herington was again
married, his second union being with Miss Dina Arntz, a native of Cochrane, Wisconsin,
by whom he has two children, Alberta and Donald. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

and has the distinction of being the only democrat ever elected from his county
to the state legislature, to which he was sent as a representative in 1897. He
has served on the town board and for eight years filled the office of mayor,
carefully directing municipal affairs with the same thoroughness and capability
that have marked his business career. That he is interested in the cause of
education has been shown by his effective work as a member of the school board.
Progress has ever been his watchword and he seeks for the public good with the
same eagerness and enthusiasm that he displays in advancing his individual interests.
