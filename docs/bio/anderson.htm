<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>Frank
Anderson</span></b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>,
actively engaged in the practice of law at Webster, was born in Fillmore
county, Minnesota, October 18, 1870, and is a son of Iver and Kari (Erickson)
Anderson, both of whom were natives of Norway, born in 1842 and 1839
respectively. His grandfather and grandmother on his mother’s side, Mr. and
Mrs. Eric Nortomme, came to the United States and spent their remaining days on
this side of the water. In his native country the grandfather had followed the
shoemaker’s trade. Iver Anderson arrived in Fillmore County, Minnesota, in the
year 1868, purchased school land there and lived upon his farm for ten years.
He afterward removed to Lac qui Parle County, Minnesota, and purchased a
relinquishment claim in 1880. He then devoted his energies to the further
development and improvement of that property until 1902, when he retired from
active business life and now resides in Montevideo, Minnesota. His efforts were
attended with success and he is now the possessor of a comfortable competence. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>While
in Fillmore County, Minnesota, he wedded Kari Erickson, who passed away on the
25th of June 1912. In their family were four children, of whom two are yet
living, the younger being Ingeborg, now the wife of N. O. Borten, a farmer
living near Montevideo. Mr. Anderson is a member of the Lutheran church. In his
political views he is a republican and has held some local offices. Frank
Anderson pursued his early education in the public schools of Lac qui Parle County,
after which he spent two years as a student in the Windom Institute at
Montevideo and also studied for two years at Anamosa, Iowa. Later he pursued a
commercial course in Cedar Rapids and a scientific and classical course in
Valparaiso, Indiana, to which he devoted two years. He then spent a similar
period in the study of law at Valparaiso and was admitted to the bar in 1899,
after which he located for practice in Webster. He remained alone for a time
but in 1900 formed a partnership with Josephus Alley, a connection that was
maintained for five years. On the dissolution of that partnership in 1905 Mr.
Anderson became associated with W. G. Waddel and they have practiced together
since April 1906, being accorded a liberal clientage. They have been connected
with much important litigation and Mr. Anderson carefully prepares his cases so
that he is ready to meet any emergency in the courts. In 1899 was celebrated
the marriage of Mr. Anderson and Miss Helen Sophie Knudson, of Davis, Illinois.
They are well known in Webster and the hospitality of the best homes is
cordially extended them. Their religious faith is that of the Lutheran church
and Mr. Anderson is connected with the Knights of Pythias. In politics he is a
republican and has served as states attorney of Day County for six years. He is
now a member of the board of regents of education of the state, to which office
he was appointed by Governor Byrne in April, 1914. He belongs to the State Bar
Association and has the high regard of his contemporaries and colleagues in
practice. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
