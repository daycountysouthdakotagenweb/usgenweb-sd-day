style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>CHARLES HENRY SHELDON</span></b><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>, second governor of the
state of South Dakota was born in LaMoille County, Vermont, the son of Greshem
and Mary (Brown) Sheldon, and was the third in a family of four, consisting of
two sons and two daughters. Greshem Sheldon was a hatter by trade and for many
years was a resident of Montreal where he owned an independent business, but,
meeting with reverses, died in 1844, a poor man, when Charles was but four
years of age. Mrs. Sheldon lived to be eighty-six years of age, dying in 1890
at the home of Charles, whose constant are she had been throughout his life.
The early life of Governor Sheldon was a hard struggle. His mother was very
poor and he was compelled to work from his earliest recollection to eke out the
family expenses. Until approaching manhood he found employment on farms and
then for several years in small stores; nevertheless he managed to pick up a
good deal of elementary learning and from his childhood was passionately fond
of oratory, in which he constantly trained himself. His sympathetic nature made
him a natural abolitionist and when the war broke out, when he was in his
twenty-first year, he promptly offered his services, but upon his first
enlistment he was, upon physical examination, for some reason rejected. He
enlisted again on the 23d of November 1861, and was duly mustered into service
in Company E, Seventh Regiment Vermont Volunteer Infantry. His military service
was highly creditable and at the close of the war he had won the position of
second lieutenant of Company I of the Seventh Regiment. After the war he
settled in Golconda, Pope County, Illinois, where he engaged in mercantile
business, and later he was connected with a large tobacco commission house at
Paducah, Kentucky. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>In
1880 Governor Sheldon removed to Dakota and settled upon government land near
Pierpont, Day County where he opened a farm and built a home, which he
maintained until his death. In 1886 he was sent to the territorial legislature
and in 1892 he was chosen governor of the state, which position he filled with
credit for four years. There have been no more difficult years in the history
of the west than the four during which Charles H. Sheldon held the governor's
chair in South Dakota. Before he had been in office six months the great
national panic of 1893 was on and the period of depression continued throughout
his term. To add to the embarrassments of the period, came the almost total
crop failure of 1894 and upon the heels of that the Taylor defalcation of
January I, 1895, by which the state treasury was robbed of every dollar.
Throughout all of these trying experiences the Governor labored unceasingly to
maintain the state's credit and with results as good as could be hoped for when
adverse conditions are considered. At the close of his second term he retired
quietly to his farm and lived in simple comfort until the campaign of 1898 came
on, when he responded to the call of his party to engage in a speaking campaign
in the state and was assigned to a series of appointments in the Black Hills
and made one of his most powerful speeches in the city of Deadwood on Saturday
night October 15. Almost immediately following the close of his address he was
taken with a chill. Pneumonia followed and he died at the Bullock Hotel on
Thursday morning following, shortly after his wife and son reached his bedside.

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>Governor
Sheldon was twice married. His first wife was Miss Mary Waters, of Pope County,
Illinois, to whom he was married shortly after the war and whose death occurred
in 1874. She left him no children. He was married in 1875 to Miss Martha
Frizzell, of Johnson County, Illinois, and the union was blessed with three
children James B., Ethel and Charles H. James died in 1894, while a student at
Brookings College. Governor Sheldon was a man of marked ability, of good and
strong impulses and his memory is cherished in South Dakota by a host of
friends. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
