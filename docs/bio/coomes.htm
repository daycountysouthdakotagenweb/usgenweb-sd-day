<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>ISAIAH
S. COOMES</span></b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>,
county judge of Day county, has in his professional connections won a most
creditable and prominent position and his ability as a fair and impartial judge
is indicated in the fact that he has been reelected to the office in which he
is now serving. He was born in Cass County, Iowa, July 12, 1878, and is a son
of Oll and Addie (Kellogg) Coomes. The former was a son of Isaiah Coomes, who
for a number of years resided in Ohio and removed thence to Iowa, where his
remaining days were passed. His life was devoted to the occupation of farming.
Oll Coomes was born in Ohio in 1858 and after coming to Iowa was married in
Colfax to Miss Addie Kellogg, who was born in 1857 in Vermont and died in 1907.
Mr. Coomes turned his attention to agricultural pursuits after reaching Iowa
and in the conduct of his business affairs met with a substantial measure of
success. He is also well known as the author of several novels, which have been
well received, and is a notable figure in the literary circles of his state. In
politics, too, he has figured prominently and after filling some local offices
was elected to represent his district in the state legislature for a term
covering the years 1878-1879. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>His
political allegiance has always been given to the Republican Party. He belongs
to the Methodist Episcopal Church and is also a member of the Independent Order
of Odd Fellows. In the family of Oll and Addie (Kellogg) Coomes were three
children, but one of the number, Roy, is now deceased. The second son, Arthur,
is a farmer of Iowa. Mr. Coomes was married in 1913 to Miss Addie Johnson. The
third son is Judge Coomes of this review, who pursued his education in the
schools of Iowa, being graduated from the high school at Wiota, that state.
Later he continued his education at Atlantic, Iowa, and also pursued a course
in a business college at Des Moines. He next entered upon the study of law and
completed a course in the law department of the State University of South
Dakota with the class of 1907. In July of the same year he located in Webster
and for four years continued in the practice of his profession with John Lund,
since which time he has been alone. He is an able lawyer and while in active
practice was always most conscientious and careful in the preparation of his
cases, while his presentation of a cause was marked by force and clearness In 1912,
his fellow citizens, appreciative of his worth and his ability as a member of
the bar, elected him to the office of county judge and gave their endorsement
of his first term's service in a reelection in 1914. He is a republican in
politics and had previously held some local offices, serving as township clerk
in Iowa and as justice of the peace in Webster. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>In
1906 Judge Coomes was united in marriage to Miss Grace E. Love, who was born in
Cass County, Iowa, a daughter of D. R. Love, a stock buyer of that state. Judge
and Mrs. Coomes are prominent socially and enjoy the hospitality of the best
homes of Webster and of the county. They are members of the Methodist Episcopal
Church and the Judge is prominent and active in the Odd Fellows and Masonic
lodges. He has attained to the Royal Arch Chapter in Masonry and for two years
was worshipful master of his lodge, while for three years he was noble grand of
the Odd Fellows lodge, serving as a representative from the subordinate lodge
to the grand lodge for two years. His ideals of life are high and he lives up
to his standards. The opportunities, which have come to him, he has improved
not only for the benefit of his own interests but also for the welfare and
upbuilding of the community in which he lives. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
