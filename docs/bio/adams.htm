<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>The
name of William S. D. Adams is well known in newspaper circles throughout the
northwest, for he is editor and owner of the Reporter and Farmer, published at
Webster. He was born in Clinton, Illinois, March 26, 1862, and is a son of
James C. and Elizabeth (Demon) Adams. The father, who was born in Virginia in
1841, died in November 1903, having for a number of years survived his wife,
who passed away in 1885. She was born in Ireland in 1844 and they were married
in Clinton, Illinois. James C. Adams had accompanied his parents to Clinton
when he was a small child. His father was William W. Adams, who became a
resident of Clinton at a very early day and there spent the remainder of his
life, practicing medicine at that place for many years. The maternal
grandfather, William S. Denton, was born in England, became a civil engineer
and worked for the English government, being noted as a bridge builder,
operating under the name of Denton &amp; Childs. He made the first survey of
the Chicago river. James C. Adams was educated in a Kentucky college and left
school in order to enter the army at the time of the Civil war. He served in an
Illinois regiment, being on active duty for three and a half years and after
being wounded at the battle of Shiloh was in the hospital for some time. He was
on duty with the ram fleet and was on the Queen of the West when it sank in
front of Vicksburg but was among the number who escaped. When the war was over
he went to Mississippi and published one of the three newspapers then issued in
the state. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>In
connection with John B. Raymond and General H. R. Rees he stumped the state for
the republican nominee for governor but the Ku Klux clan became antagonistic
and took his printing outfit, which they sank in the Mississippi River. In 1871
Mr. Adams went to Iowa and established a paper at Avoca, which he called the
Delta, conducting it with success until 1883, when he removed with his family
to Webster, South Dakota, and purchased the Reporter and Farmer. He also
established the Day County Daylight, which he issued on his claim, which was
situated eighteen miles from a post office and thirty miles from a railroad,
while it was a mile and a half to the home of his nearest neighbor. He and his
son, William S. D. Adams, both took claims of one hundred and sixty acres and
the son proved up his claim, after which he went to Britton and was the first
postmaster of that place. James C. Adams sold his interest in the Farmer and
Reporter in 1891 and purchased the Howard County Times at Cresco, Iowa,
continuing its publication until his death in 1902. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>By
his first marriage he had seven children, of whom three are living: Maude, the
wife of George H. Baker, a miller of Deer Park, Washington; Josiah J., a
printer in his brother's office; and William S. D. After losing his first wife
James C. Adams was married in 1887 to Mrs. Jessie G. White, who is now living
at Lake Helen, Florida. For two years after her husband's death she conducted
the paper which he had been issuing at Cresco, Iowa. She has been very
prominent in the Woman's Christian Temperance Union and in the equal franchise
work and directed the last campaign for woman's suffrage in Florida. She is
well known as a writer upon topics of vital interest and is a lady of broad and
liberal education and culture. Mr. Adams was a member of the Methodist
Episcopal Church, while the mother of William S. D. Adams belonged to the
Episcopal Church. The father was connected with the blue lodge and the chapter
in Masonry and with the Independent Order of Odd Fellows and passed through all
the chairs in those organizations His political allegiance was ever given to
the republican party from its formation and at one time he served as state
senator. He became a charter member and was also the president of the State
Press Association for a number of years. William S. D. Adams pursued his education
in the public schools of Avoca, Iowa, and in his youth took up newspaper work,
which he has followed throughout his entire life. He engaged in business with
his father in Iowa in 1881 and afterward came with him to South Dakota, since
which time he has continued in newspaper publication in this state. He sold the
Daylight in 1885, at which time the name of that paper was changed to the
Marshall County Journal, under which title it has since been published. Mr.
Adams still owns and publishes the Reporter and Farmer, which has a circulation
of twelve hundred, and in addition he does a large job printing and book
binding business. His office is well equipped and the work, which he turns out,
is first class. He thoroughly understands the printing trade in every
particular and is thus able to direct the labors of those whom he employs.
Fraternally Mr. Adams is connected with the Masons, has passed through all of
the chairs of the blue lodge and is connected with the Royal Arch Chapter. In
politics he is a republican, believing firmly in the principles of the party,
but he does not seek nor desire office, preferring to devote his entire
attention to his newspaper interests. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
