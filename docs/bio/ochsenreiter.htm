style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>, proprietor of a garage at
Webster and owner of a large farm, was born in Harrison county, Indiana,
February 17, 1857, a son of Gephard and Pauline Ochsenreiter, both of whom were
natives of Germany, in which country they were reared and married. The father,
born in 1813, died in 1867. In 1848 he came to the New World, settling in
Indiana, and throughout his entire life engaged in business as a tin and
coppersmith. He and his wife were members of the Catholic Church and in that
faith they reared their family of twelve children. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>Louis
G. Ochsenreiter, the only one now living, was educated in the schools of
Minnesota, to which state the family removed just prior to the close of the
Civil war. He had very few advantages in his youth. His mother hired him out
for a year to work for his board and four dollars per month. Out of his wage
for the year he gave his mother forty dollars. He was afterward employed in a
hardware store in St. Paul for a year and still later began selling farm
machinery at Jordan, Minnesota. In 1880 he arrived in Day County, South Dakota,
and filed on a homestead and a tree claim. In the spring of 1881 he established
a hardware business at Webster although there were but few inhabitants in that
part of the county. He had the first store on the town site, conducting it in
partnership with Andrew Smail, the firm continuing actively and successfully in
business for about twenty years under the style of Ochsenreiter &amp; Smail. In
1900 the senior partner turned his attention to the implement business, which
he successfully conducted until 1915. He is now proprietor of a garage and
sells the Reo, Cadillac and Saxon cars. Already he has established a gratifying
business and the growing popularity of the automobile, together with his
enterprise and honorable business methods, contribute to his success. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>In
1887 Mr. Ochsenreiter married Miss Nellie R. Murphy, a native of Arena,
Wisconsin, and in Webster and throughout the county they are well known. They
hold membership in the Catholic Church and Mr. Ochsenreiter belongs to the
Knights of Columbus. A stanch republican in politics, he was elected the first
county treasurer of Day county. He served as president of the village board
before Webster was incorporated as a city and several times he has been a
member of the school board. He was also a member of the state come mission at
the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago and helped to raise twenty-five
thousand dollars for the commission, securing the money throughout the state.
Later, however, the legislature appropriated fifty thousand dollars, reimbursing
the donors of the previous twenty-five thousand dollars. Mr. Ochsenreiter held
the federal position of examiner in the department of justice and in all of the
offices that he has filled has proven able, capable and faithful. He still owns
his old homestead and tree claim, three miles south of Webster, and since
locating thereon he has contributed in large measure to the development and
upbuilding of Day County, which he helped to organize and in which he was one
of the first settlers. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
