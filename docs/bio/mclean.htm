Donald McLean, senator from Day county and a well-known ranchman making his
home at Webster, was born in Morrisburg, Ontario, Canada, February 19, 1869.
His father, William McLean, was a teacher and farmer who, after attending
school in his native country, Scotland, began imparting to others the knowledge
that he had acquired, making an excellent record as an educator. In 1835 he
crossed the Atlantic to Canada, settling on a farm near Morrisburg, Ontario,
where his remaining days were passed, his death there occurring January 28,
1904, when he had reached the age of eighty-two years. His wife, who bore the
maiden name of Sarah Reddick, was a native of New England, descended from early
colonial settlers, and her mother was an own cousin of Dr. Oliver Wendell
Holmes. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>Donald
McLean was but eleven years of age at the time of his mother's demise and soon
afterward he started out to make his own way in the world. He attended the
public schools until he reached his fifteenth year, working between terms to
pay his way and afterward entering college in order to pursue theological
studies. In 1888 he arrived in Dakota territory, settling at Watertown, where
he became a licensed Methodist preacher He was appointed to the Waverly circuit
and the following year was given a regular pastorate at Wilmot, Roberts county.
In 1891 he returned to the Northwestern University at Evanston, Illinois, to
complete his theological studies and his academic and college work, and when he
again came to South Dakota he was assigned by his conference to the pastorate
at Webster and this was followed by appointments to churches in Centerville and
in Vermillion. In 1901 he returned to Webster, Day County, and he now divides
his time between the work of the pulpit and the lecture platform and the
operation of a ranch of eleven hundred acres. He has studied agriculture with
the same thoroughness that he has given to other lines of investigation and
research, and therefore wisely directs the cultivation and development of his
ranch. He is an earnest and fluent speaker and a logical thinker, and his
presentation of any subject awakens interest and consideration. He has also
taken an active part in political affairs and is a stalwart republican. In 1912
he was elected to represent his district in the state senate and at the close
of a two years' term was reelected in 1914. He has proven one of the most able
members of the upper house, taking a most active and intelligent part in the
discussion of all measures of vital interest to the commonwealth. He has also
done good work on important committees, including the appropriations, highways,
public institutions, legislative expenses and agriculture committees. He has
been especially active in the discussion of legislation relating to textbooks,
to bridge construction, to taxation and to banking and his utterances along
those subjects have elicited earnest thought and have won for the cause which
he has championed hearty support. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>On
the 25th of October 1898, Mr. McLean was united in marriage to Miss Lyle Olive
Harris, daughter of Dr. and Mrs. J. L. Harris, of Webster, South Dakota. To
them have been born five children, namely: Donald,. Jr., John L., Malcolm,
Marian and Wallace. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>Fraternally
Mr. McLean is connected with the Masons. He enjoys hunting and various phases
of outdoor life but also finds recreation in the study of literature,
philosophy, political and civil history and government. He is a broad-minded
man whom nature endowed with mental force and who has wisely used his time,
talent and opportunities. He owes his educational training to his own labors,
which provided him the means necessary to continue his studies and meet his
expenses during his student days. All through his life he has been a student,
reading broadly, thinking deeply and arriving at deductions which mature public
opinion has endorsed He enjoys perhaps more than all else the mental stimulus
which comes through the discussion of important topics and questions of
interest vital to the political situation or which affect the sociological and
economic conditions of the country. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
