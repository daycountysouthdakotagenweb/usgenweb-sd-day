B. JENKINS, M. D, of Waubay, who is serving as superintendent of the South
Dakota State Board of Health, has proved very efficient in that capacity and
has done much to promote public hygiene. He was born in Newport, Vermont,
November 14, 1873, a son of S. W. and Francelia (Sias) Jenkins. The paternal
grandfather, William Jenkins, was born in Vermont, as was the maternal
grandfather, Ezra Sias, who resided in the Green Mountain State throughout his
entire life. Both the parents of our subject were born in that state, the
father in 1840 and the mother in 1850. They grew to mature years there and were
there married. In 1882 they removed from Vermont to Waubay, South Dakota, and
the father homesteaded land on which the family resided for about five years. A
removal was then made to the town of Waubay, where he ran a railroad-eating
house for a number of years. He is a well-informed man, although he had but
limited educational opportunities in his youth, for he has always been a
student of men and events. His political belief is that of the socialist party.
For three years he served in the Civil war, proving a loyal and efficient
soldier, and he held the rank of sergeant. To him and his wife have been born
two children: Park B.; and Clinton a., also of Waubay, who is connected with
the state game department. Dr. Park B. Jenkins was graduated from the high school
of Webster, South Dakota, in 1893 and subsequently entered the University of
Illinois, from which he was graduated in medicine in 1896. For one year he was
connected with the health department of the city of Chicago and for a like
Period of time he was in a hospital at Marquette, Michigan, thus further
preparing for his life work. In 1898 he began the private practice of his
profession at Waubay, where he has since remained. In 1909 he was appointed a
member of the state board of health and in 1912 was appointed superintendent of
that body, in which position his work proved so satisfactory that on the 1st of
July, 1915, he was re-appointed to that office by Governor Byrne. He gives the
greater part of his time to his official duties and is continually seeking new
ways in which the board may further safeguard the public health. He is a member
of the State Medical Society, the American Medical Association, the
International Congress of Hygiene and Demography, and of the Association of
State and Provincial Boards of Health. Dr. Jenkins gives his political
allegiance to the Republican Party, believing that its policies are based upon
sound principles of government. Fraternally he is connected with the knights of
Pythias and the Woodmen and is popular in those organizations. In capably
discharging the important duties that devolve upon him as superintendent of the
state board of health he has gained a statewide reputation for ability and
integrity and has the confidence of both the general public and the -medical
profession <o:p></o:p></span></p>
