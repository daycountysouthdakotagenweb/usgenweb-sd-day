<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>FRANK
W. HALBKAT</span></b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>.
Modern business enterprise finds expression in the activity of Frank W. Halbkat,
a druggist of Webster. He was born in Hamilton, Minnesota, November 15, 1875, a
son of John C. and Helen (Tessin) Halbkat, both of whom are still living. The
paternal grandfather, Fred Halbkat, was a native of Germany, and after living
for some years in the United States returned to that country, where his
remaining days were passed. John C. Halbkat, the father of our subject, was
born in New York in 1850. The mother's birth occurred in Germany in the same
year and they are now residents of Spring Valley, Minnesota, where they were
married in 1869. Mrs. Halbkat was a young lady of seventeen years when she
crossed the Atlantic and Mr. Halbkat was a child of but five years when he
accompanied his parents to Minnesota, the family home being established on a farm
near Brown Valley, that state. He acquired his education in the common schools
and took up the occupation of farming, which he followed until 1880, when he
removed to Spring Valley and embarked in merchandising, in which business he
has won a gratifying measure of success. His religious belief is that of the
Methodist Episcopal church and his fraternal relations connect him with the
Masons, the Odd Fellows and other fraternal organizations. In politics he is an
earnest republican. He has ever been active in support of the principles in
which he believes. To him and his wife have been born five children: Charles
F., who is engaged in the jewelry business at Watertown, South Dakota; Emma,
the wife of Calvin Young, of Mapleton, Minnesota; Frank W.; Alice, the wife of
John Hoffman, a real-estate dealer and banker of Spring Valley, Minnesota; and
John H., who is associated with his father in general merchandising. After
attending the high school at Spring Valley, from which he was graduated with
the chess of 1892, Frank W. Halbkat entered the Northwestern University at
Chicago, Illinois, and completed a course in pharmacy in 1895. He afterward
engaged in clerking until 1903 and on the 1st of April of that year removed to
Webster, where he bought out the business of the Ross Drug Company and has
since conducted the store. He now has a well appointed establishment, carrying
a large and carefully selected line of drugs and druggists, sundries, while his
reasonable prices and courteous treatment of his patrons have secured to him a
growing and substantial trade. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>In
November, 1905, Mr. Halbkat wedded Miss Ethel M. Walker, a native of Nebraska
and a daughter of Franklin Walker, who was one of the early settlers of
Nebraska and afterward became a pioneer resident of South Dakota. He is now
living retired at Clark, this state. Mr. and Mrs. Halbkat have two children,
John F., and Frederick W., aged respectively seven and two years. In the fall
of 1913 Mr. Halbkat was appointed to the state board of pharmacy by Governor Frank
M. Byrne and in October of the present year, 1915, became president of the
state board of pharmacy. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
