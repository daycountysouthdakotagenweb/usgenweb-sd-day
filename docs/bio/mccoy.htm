H. McCOY</span></b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>,
who is now serving on the bench of the fifth judicial circuit of the state, was
born on a farm near Oakley, Macon county, Illinois, on the 14th of July, 1855,
the son of Benjamin F. and Minerva D. (Helm) McCoy, the former of whom was born
and reared in Greenbrier county, Virginia, where he devoted his active life to
agricultural pursuits. He is now a resident of Oakley, Illinois, of which state
he is an honored pioneer. His wife was born near the city of Baltimore,
Maryland, in 1830, and died at Oakley, Illinois, in 1889. The subject of this
sketch pursued his studies in the district schools during his boyhood days and
then entered the high school at Decatur, Illinois, where he fitted himself for
matriculation in the Illinois Wesleyan University, at Bloomington, being graduated
in the law department of that institution as a member of the class of 1880.
During the following two years he gave his attention principally to teaching in
the public schools of his native state, and in 1883 he was appointed special
field examiner for the United States pension department, with headquarters in
Louisville, Kentucky. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>In
July, 1885, he was dismissed from this position on account of &quot;offensive
partisanship,&quot; and the following month he opened a law office at Britton,
Marshall County, Dakota territory, there continuing in active practice until
1893, when he removed to Webster, Day County, South Dakota, where he built up a
large and important law business, remaining in practice there until January,
1900, when he transferred his residence and professional headquarters to the
city of Aberdeen. His practice was of general character, and from 1890 to 1901
he probably tried as many civil cases as any other attorney in the circuit,
this fact standing in unmistakable evidence of his ability and the confidence
reposed in him by the public. In 1887 Judge McCoy was appointed county auditor
of Marshall County, and two years later was elected county judge of that
county, being re-elected in 1892. In 1901 he was elected to his present
exacting and responsible office of judge of the circuit court of the fifth
judicial circuit, embracing the counties of Brown, Beadle, Day, Grant,
Marshall, Spink and Roberts. His rulings on the bench have shown him to be
possessed of a clear, judicial mind, a thorough knowledge of the minutiae of
the law, and a desire to subordinate all else to the ends of justice, so that
he has but augmented his hold upon popular confidence and esteem. On April 27,
1904, at the judicial convention held at Webster, the Judge was re-nominated by
acclamation for a second term of four and a half years as judge. The Judge is
an uncompromising advocate of the principles of the Republican Party, in whose
cause he has rendered effective service, having served as chairman of the
central committees of both Marshall and Day counties. Fraternally he is
identified with the Masonic order, having served two years as senior warden of
Coteau Lodge, while a resident of Webster; he is also a member of the Modern
Woodmen of America, and of the Ancient Order of United Workmen. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>In
Springfield, Illinois, on the 27th of June, 1883, Judge McCoy was married to
Miss Hanna F. Heath, and they have two children, Lelah K., who was born March
11, 1886, and James C., who was born October 18, 1892. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
