style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>., is one of the most
prominent physicians and surgeons of Webster, and a pioneer of Day county, Dr.
Harris was born near Battle Creek, Michigan, January 3, 1849, and is the son of
James M. and Eliza (Cosad) Harris, both natives of New York. James Harris was a
farmer by occupation and settled in Michigan in the year 1845. He remained
there until 1880 and then went to Roberts County, South Dakota. He soon
afterward removed to Webster and still resides there. Our subject's mother died
when he was an infant. There were but two children in the family, John and
Adelbert, the latter being killed in Missouri in 1870. John received his
education in the common schools of Michigan, and at Olivet College, in that
state. After leaving the latter institution he worked at various things for
some time, and in June 1871, began the study of medicine under Dr. Batherick,
of Battle Creek, Michigan. He thus continued for three years, during which time
he also attended the Hahnemann Medical College, of Chicago, Illinois. He was
graduated from this institution in 1875, but had already begun practice at
Eastport, Michigan, the year previously. He remained there until the fall of
1875 and then removed to Ovid, Michigan, where he practiced during the
following year. In 1877 Dr. Harris went to Roanoke, Indiana, and made his home
there until 1880, when he removed to Browns Valley, Minnesota. After spending
about one year there he went to Webster, South Dakota, and in June, 1881, began
practice there, which he has since continued. In the fall of 1890 he entered
the College of Physicians and Surgeons, at Chicago, and spent one year there,
being graduated in the spring of 1891. Dr. Harris in 1881 established the first
drug store in Day County at Webster, and conducted it very successfully until
1886, when he sold out. He takes considerable interest in fine cattle, and now
has a herd of blooded stock upon his farm, near Webster. Dr. Harris is
president of the state board of health and medical examiners, having been
appointed to that position April 1, 1895; he is also a member of the state
medical society, and for years was connected with the National Association of
Railway Surgeons, being at that time a local surgeon for the Chicago, Milwaukee
&amp; Saint Paul railway.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Doctor is a stanch Republican, and has taken an active part in local affairs,
having at one time served as county commissioner Day County. He is a member of
the Masonic fraternity, and a charter member of the local lodge, in which he
has filled all the chairs. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

1875 Dr. Harris married Miss Sarah J. Buckley, of Eastport, Michigan, a
daughter of P. H. and Olive Buckley. Dr. and Mrs. Harris are the parents of two
children, a son, Rex, and a daughter, Lyle O., now attending school at
Kalamazoo, Michigan. Dr. Harris enjoys a very extensive practice, both in Day
and surrounding counties, and is one of the best known and most popular medical
men in that part of the state.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
