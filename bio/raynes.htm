newspaper men of Day county He was born in Greenwich, England, January 28,
1856, and his parents, John G. and Sarah (Newman) Raynes, were also natives of
that country. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They brought their family to America when their son Alfred
was two years of age, the family home being established near Fond du Lac,
Wisconsin, whence a removal was afterward made to Danville, Dodge County. It
was there that Alfred E. Raynes learned the printer’s trade in the office of
the Columbus Republican and still later he was employed on various dailies in
Chicago. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He became identified with newspaper publication in the
Dakota Territory when in 1884 he purchased the Andover Gazette, which he has
since conducted with growing and gratifying success. He has kept in touch with
the trend of progress along journalistic lines, publishes a neat and attractive
sheet and in the dissemination of local and general news meets the wishes of
his readers and has thereby gained a liberal patronage. He is also the owner of
one hundred and sixty acres of land near Andover. Aside from his activity in
business he has done much to further public progress. </p>

the position of postmaster. A stalwart republican, he has been chairman of the
county republican central committee and for a long time was its secretary.
During President Harrison's administration he was a member of the republican
state central committee and was by him appointed postmaster. No movement
relating to the welfare of the community fails to elicit his interest and when
his judgment sanctions a plan he gives to it hearty cooperation. </p>

fraternity and the Eastern Star and erected the first story of the Masonic
Hall, which was finished by the Masons. His is a well-rounded development,

of a community, and in personal connections as well as in editorial avenues he
has contributed much to public progress. </p>
