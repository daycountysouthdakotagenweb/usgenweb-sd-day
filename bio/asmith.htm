<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>ALBERT
SMITH was born in the village of Laharpe, Hancock County, Illinois. He was
granted the advantages of the common schools in his youth and thereafter took a
course of study in Knox College, at Galesburg, Illinois. In 1872 he removed to
Minnesota, where he remained until 1875, when he returned home, by reason of
the impaired health of his father, who died shortly afterward. The subject
again went to Minnesota, and established himself in the hardware business in
Wright county, where he continued, operations about six years, meeting with fair
success. His health finally became delicate and this led to his removing to
South Dakota, whither he came in 1883. He located on a farm eight miles north
of Britton, in Day County, the place being now in Marshall County, and shortly
afterward he returned to Howard, Minnesota. I<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>n
the spring of 1884 he came once more to Day County, South Dakota, and became
one of the organizers of the first bank in Webster, while he served as cashier
of the same until 1888, when the institution was closed, owing to depressed
financial conditions, though the promoters of the enterprise allowed none of
their patrons to lose by reason of the suspension. In the autumn of that year
Mr. Smith was elected county auditor, of which office he continued incumbent
for the long period of six years, after which he served in various other
offices of public trust and responsibility, ever proving himself a
discriminating and faithful executive. In 1900 he was elected clerk of the
courts, and has since served as such. He is also representative of a number of
the leading fire-insurance companies and does a very considerable business as
underwriter for the same. Fraternally he is identified with the Masonic order,
and also with the Independent Order of Odd Fellows and the Knights of Pythias.
Mr. Smith was united in marriage to Miss Hannah J. Alley, who was born in West
Virginia, and they have two sons.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
