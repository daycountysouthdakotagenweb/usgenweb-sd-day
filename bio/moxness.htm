<p class=MsoNormal>Alfred J. Moxness, cashier of the State Bank of Andover, was
born in Elizabeth, Minnesota, December 4, 1882, and is the eldest in a family
of nine children, eight of whom are living. The parents are Nick and Marine
Moxness, natives of Norway, born in 1860 and 1861 respectively. They were
married in that country and soon afterward crossed the Atlantic, settling in
Elizabeth, Minnesota, where the father worked as a laborer. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>During the pioneer epoch in the history of Day County, South
Dakota, they made their way to Bristol and the same year, 1885, the father
homesteaded land, after which he bent his energies to the development and
improvement of the farm, which he occupied and successfully operated until
1909. Since that year he has been engaged in buying grain in Bristol and
success in gratifying measure has attended his efforts. He and his wife are consistent
Christian people, holding membership in the Lutheran church. His political
views accord with republican principles and he has served as county
commissioner and otherwise taken part in political activity. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In his youthful days Alfred J. Moxness divided his time
between attendance at the district schools and work upon the home farm, giving
his father the benefit of his services until he attained his majority. He then
turned from agricultural life to become bookkeeper in a bank, where he was
employed from 1904 until 1911. In the latter year he removed to Andover,
accepting the position as cashier of the State Bank of Andover, which is a
growing and reliable institution capitalized for ten thousand dollars, with
surplus and undivided profits of forty-five hundred dollars and average
deposits of seventy-five thousand dollars. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In 1907 Mr. Moxness was united in marriage to Miss Serena
Aadland, a native of Day County and a daughter of Hans Aadland, who was an
early settler of Day county, this state. Our subject and his wife have two
children, Harley and Alfred, Jr. Reared in the faith of the Lutheran church,
Mr. Moxness has always adhered to its teachings and is one of the faithful
members of that denomination in Bristol. He belongs to the Masons, the Independent
Order of Odd Fellows, the Knights of the Maccabees and to the Elks lodge of
Aberdeen. In politics a republican, he is now serving as town clerk and was
also deputy treasurer of Day County in 1907 but at the end of a year resigned
his position and resumed active connection with the banking business, in which
he has made a creditable record. He has carefully studied every phase of the
business and contributes in large measure to the success of the institution
with which he is now connected and which finds in him a most popular and
obliging official. </p>
