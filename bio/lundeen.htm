<p class=MsoNormal>A.E. LUNDEEN. One of the leading business interests of
Bristol is the implement house of A. E. Lundeen, an enterprising merchant who
belongs to that class of representative citizens that Sweden has furnished to
this state—a class that has done much toward the upbuilding and material
development of South Dakota. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He was born in Sweden, July 8, 1880, his parents being
Magnus P. and Benta Lundeen, also natives of Sweden, born in 1841 and 1843
respectively. Coming to the United States in 1880, they settled in Day County,
Dakota territory, where the father secured a homestead claim which he owned and
occupied throughout his remaining days, winning success as the reward of the
industry and determination which he displayed in the conduct of his business
interests. He died in 1887, while his wife survived until 1911. They were
members of the Lutheran church and in his political views Mr. Lundeen was a
republican. To them were born four children, three of whom survive, namely:
Peter, an agriculturist residing in Bristol; A. E., of this review; and Emma,
who gave her hand in marriage to Albert Ziegenhagen, a farmer living in North
Dakota. It was during his infancy that A. E. Lundeen was brought to Dakota Territory
and in the schools of Day county he pursued his education, supplemented by a
commercial course at Valparaiso, Indiana. His early experiences were those of
the farm and he continued to engage in agricultural pursuits until 1905, when
he removed to Bristol, turning his attention to the implement business, in
which connection he has built up a good trade. He handles farm machinery of
standard makes and his reliability in trade transactions, combined with his
energy and experiences have brought to him a gratifying patronage. He also owns
two farms in Day County and his property is the evidence of a life of well
directed energy and thrift. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In 1907 Mr. Lundeen was united in marriage to Miss Emma
Vehe, a native of Day County, South Dakota, and a daughter of John L. Vehe, who
is a retired agriculturist residing in Bristol. Our subject and his wife have
two children: Roumelle, who is attending school; and Lloyd. The religious faith
of Mr. and Mrs. Lundeen is that of the Lutheran church, while his fraternal
connections are with the Odd Fellows lodge of Bristol, in which he has passed
all of the chairs. He exercises his right of franchise in support of the men
and measures of the republican party and for three years served as mayor of
Bristol, carefully directing its interests and seeking at all times to uphold
and promote those movements and projects which are a matter of civic virtue and
civic pride. </p>
