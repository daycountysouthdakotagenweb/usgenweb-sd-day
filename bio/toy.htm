<p class=MsoNormal>Harrison Toy enlisted as a soldier in an Ohio regiment of
volunteers soon after the outbreak of the war of the Rebellion and was in
active service for three years, receiving his honorable discharge and returning
to his home, where he died a few days later, as the result of injuries and
hardships endured while in the army. The subject was a lad of about seven years
at the time of his father's death, and passed his boyhood days principally on
the home farm, while his educational training was secured in the public schools
of Mount Vernon, Ohio, where he completed a partial course in the high school.
He early became inured to the sturdy work of the farm, and after leaving school
was successfully engaged in teaching for several terms, also clerking in a
store, and being thus engaged until he had attained the age of twenty-one
years. </p>

associated with his brothers Frank, John and Seymour in the general store business
until the latter part of the year 1884. In the spring of 1885 he came to
Andover, Dakota Territory, and here has ever since maintained his home. He
became identified with farming interests and also established himself in the
general merchandise business, to which latter he is now giving his entire time
and attention. though he is still the owner of an excellent farm in the county.

to the Republican party, and was continuously incumbent of some one or other of
the village and county offices until his election to the state senate, in 1899,
since retiring from which dignified and responsible position he has not
permitted his name to be used in connection with nomination for any office. </p>

Episcopal church in their home town and enjoy the utmost popularity in the
social affairs of the community. On the 13th of June, 1886, Mr. Toy was united
in marriage to Mrs. Olive J. Curtice, of Andover, who was born in Stewartville,
Minnesota being a daughter of William Smith, a representative citizen of that
place. Mr. and. Mrs. Toy have two children, Victor and Horace, aged
