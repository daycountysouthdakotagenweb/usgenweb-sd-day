font-family:"Courier New"'>KRISTIANNA SIGDESTAD OLSON<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<P>Kristianna Sigdestad was born September 23, 1861 in Opstryn, Nordfjord, Norway to parent Sakarias and
Synneve (HJelle) Sigdestad. She was baptized and confirmed in the Lutheran
Faith in Norway.

<p) In this beautiful country with its valleys, Fjords, mountains, and waterfalls, she
spent her childhood. She had the privilege of attending the school on the
location where they lived on the gaard (farm) Sigdestad. Being children of humble
peasants, it became their lot in early life to leave home and work for their
living. This was rugged and often my mother would tell of how hard she was
compelled to work for her master where she milked cows and made cheese
products. Her food was rationed for a certain time, and often this was not
sufficient to quench the hunger of a growing teenager. She would be so hungry she
would go to bed weary, hungry, and weeping. These trials made her resolve in
early years to try her luck in Ameraca.

<P>At the age of 18, she emigrated to America with a cousin Rasmus Mork, arriving in Montevideo,
Minnesota the Summer of 1880. she was the first of her family to leave her
native land.

<P>She went to work in the family of a store keeper in Montevideo, Minnesota for the sum of $1.00 a
week, I think. They were a large family, but the work did not prove more
difficult than what she had been accustomed to. One advantage, the family was
not able to speak the Norwegian language so mother just had to learn their’s.

<p>On September 5, 1881 whe was married to Magnus Olson at Montevideo, Minnesota. (Marriage certificate
in Selma’s possession gives the bride’s name as Kristiarnna S. Johnson). They
moved to a rented farm between Montevideo and Granite Falls, Minnesota where
they lived until 1889. Here four children were born: Ida, Julia, A1ma, and
Emma.

<p>Soon they learned that sections of Montana were open to homesteaders. So, in the Spring of 1889,
they gathered their belongings and their family of four children into a covered
wagon drawn by a team of horses with one cow tied behind. They started out for
what they thought their destination would be, Montana.

<p> Her Mother’s parents
and two sisters had settled in Dakota Territory four years before and on their
way, they had planned to visit and rest for a few days with them. (SW corner of
Lynn Twp. Day County, about 7 miles north of Bristol). The family prevailed on
them to go no farther but locate here. The homesteads were all taken but
arrangements were made by Dad to buy a quarter section of land 3 miles east. of
Grandma Sigdestad. Here in a one room frame house, life was begun anew. A well
was drilled by Father which proved a Godsend for this well furnished water for
the entire community, including steam threshing machines. Today, the well is in
good condition and supplying water. (Selma Flakoll).

<P>The land was new, crops yielded plentifully, new hope was instilled and with each year improved.
 It was not unusual for herds cross the prairie, but with settlers moving in they soon
were either ki1led or moved on.  The prairie fires were the general
worry, The winters were severe and blizzards would last for days with snow and cold.

<p>Another quarter section of land was bought
adjoining the one they had. Here we have the trading of one of the horses for a
team of oxen because the oxen were easier keepers on the forage afforded and for field 
work proved as satisfactory.

<p>The usual hardships in pioneering were encountered, but their courage never failed them. They were
schooled in provations. Soon community life improved, churches were organized
and Dad being a stone mason by trade laid the first foundation of Bergen
Church, his labor donated to a worthy cause which proved they were much
concerned about the welfare of the coming generation, a commendable spirit.

<p> 

Nine children blessed this hone, namey:</p>

<LI>Emily Mrs. A. C. Jordanger- 18 Jan 1898</LI>

<LI>Oscar J. Olson-18 Jan 1896</LI>

<LI>One sister died in infancy. (Selma Caroline, 10 Nov 1891-12 Jan 1893.</LI>

<P>A new home was partly
complete when Father died suddenly Jan 5, 1898 just thirteen days before the
youngest sister was born. Then Mother shouldered the work of rearing her family,
managing the farm and with limited means, much ambition and labor, she proved
successful. Her interest in the affairs of church and schools and the
activities of community affairs were <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>constant.
</i>Her main concern was her family which she struggled to prepare to meet the
trials of life. Her perseverance and abounding faith in her Lord and Master was
ever sufficient.</p>

<P>Mother passed away April 27,1927 after a lingering illnessat her farm home she had helped 
establish and was buried in the Bergen Cemetery a true devoted Christian.  Her children 
were all present at her funeral.
