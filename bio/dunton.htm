<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>George
C. Dunton</span></b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>,
cashier of the First National Bank at Webster, was born in Naples, New York,
February 8, 1865, and is a representative of one of the old families of the
Empire state, his ancestors having come from England to the new world. His
grandfather, John Dunton, born in New York, was a successful farmer of that
state for many years and there occurred the birth of his son, Lemuel M., in the
year 1834. He was reared and educated at the place of his nativity and after
attaining his majority wedded Harriett E. Culver, who was born in New York in
1834, a daughter of George Culver, also a native of that state, who traced his
ancestry back to the early Puritans who settled New England. Mr. and Mrs.
Lemuel M. Dunton continued their residence in the east until 1870, when they
removed to Missouri and afterward to Kansas, Mr. Dunton devoting his attention
to sheep raising in both states. While in New York he had handled both sheep
and cattle. He won a very gratifying measure of success and was well-to-do at
the time of his demise. He was well-educated and well read and in his community
exercised considerable influence over public thought and action. He died in the
year 1910, having for a decade survived his wife, who passed away in 1900. She
was a consistent member of the Presbyterian Church. Mr. Dunton held membership
with the Masons and belonged to both the blue lodge and chapter. His political
allegiance was given to the Republican Party. To him and his wife were born two
children, George C. and Harry I., the latter a resident of Canandaigua, New
York. George C. Dunton completed his education by graduation from the
Canandaigua Academy of New York with the class of 1884 and for two years
thereafter devoted his attention to merchandising in the Empire State. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>In
1886 he arrived in South Dakota, where he engaged in clerking for a time, and
later established a store of his own at Langford. On disposing of that he lived
retired for a short period and afterward purchased a hardware store. During his
residence in Marshall County he served as treasurer for four years and was a
prominent and influential resident of that community. In 1902 he removed to
Webster and organized the First National Bank, which from the beginning has
been a substantial and paying institution. It is capitalized to twenty-five
thousand dollars, has a surplus of fifteen thousand dollars and its average
deposits amount to one hundred and sixty-five thousand dollars. A general
banking business is conducted and as its cashier Mr. Dunton has practically
managed its affairs and contributed in a very large measure to its success. He
also has farming interests in this state and is a representative businessman,
alert and enterprising. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>In
December, 1898, occurred the marriage of Mr. Dunton and Miss Clara M. Deerson a
native of Illinois and a daughter of John Deerson, who was born in Germany but
in early life came to the new world, settling in Illinois, where he followed
the cabinetmaking trade. His daughter, Mrs. Dunton, is a member of the
Episcopal church and occupies an enviable position in social circles of the
city Mr. Dunton is a prominent Mason, having taken the degrees of the Scottish
Rite and of the Mystic Shrine. A republican in his political views, he has been
active in the work of the party yet never sought office as a reward for party
fealty. He has a strong attachment for the west, which has given him his
opportunity, and he possesses the enterprising spirit, which has ever
characterized the development of this section of the country. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
