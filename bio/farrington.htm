<p class=MsoNormal>SAMUEL F. FARRINGTON. one of Day County's pioneers, and a well-to-do
and prominent citizen of Bristol, is now living in partial retirement at that
place, rounding out in peace and quiet a useful and well spent life. Mr.
Farrington was born in Prince Edward county, Ontario, Canada, July 4, 1827. His
parents were Joseph and Lucy Ann (Rorabach) Farrington, natives respectively of
Canada and New York. Joseph Farrington was a farmer by occupation and spent his
entire life in the land of his birth. Our subject's mother went to Canada when
a child with her parents, and remained there until the time of her death. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Samuel was one of a family of nine children, five sons and
four daughters, all of the others now being residents of Canada. Receiving his
education in the Dominion, Samuel lived there, cultivating a farm for many
years, and in 1881 came to this country, settling in Dakota. He made the trip
overland from Appleton, Minnesota, to his present farm in Kidder township, Day
county, with an ox team. He homesteaded land at once, and gradually added to
it, until at one time he had six hundred and forty acres, and one of the finest
and best-improved farms in the county. He has since disposed of much of his
property, and now lives at Bristol, virtually in retirement. He deals in cattle
and stock to a considerable extent, however, and is still an influential factor
in political affairs about Bristol and vicinity. Mr. Farrington is a Republican
in politics and has held a number of local offices, among them that of chairman
of the board of township trustees of Bristol Township. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>On the 30th of December 1861, Mr. Farrington married Miss
Sophia Ferguson, a daughter of Israel and Rebecca Ferguson, of Canada. Mr. and
Mrs. Farrington are the parents of one daughter, who is now the wife of Mr.
William Rankin, a well-known businessman of Bristol, South Dakota.</p>
