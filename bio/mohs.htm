<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>A
history of Webster would be incomplete were there failure to make prominent
reference to Frank Mohs, now mayor of the city and also well known in
connection with the furniture and undertaking business. He was born in Stearns
County, Minnesota, a son of Nicholas and Rose (Kolb) Mohs. The father was born
in Germany in 1842 and the mother's birth occurred in Ohio in 1844. Mr. Mohs
came to the United States with his parents when ten years of age, the family
home being established in Ohio. He was a son of Mathias Mohs, who in 1852
severed the ties that bound him to his native land and sought a home in the New
World. For a considerable period he engaged in business in Ohio as a contractor
and builder but eventually removed to Stearns County, Minnesota, where his last
days were passed. The maternal grandfather of Frank Mohs was Joseph Kolb, who
was born in Alsace-Lorraine and came to the United States in his boyhood. He,
too, settled in Ohio, where he followed the occupation of farming, and it was
in that state that Nicholas Mobs and Rose Kolb were reared. The early education
of Nicholas Mohs, which was begun in Germany, was continued in the public
schools of the Buckeye state. He became a well-educated man and one who exerted
considerable influence in the communities in which he lived. In Cleveland,
Ohio, in 1868, he wedded Rose Kolb and after his marriage removed to Stearns
county, Minnesota, becoming one of the early settlers of that locality. He had
learned the carpenter's trade in early life and had taken up the work of
contracting, but for many years he had devoted his attention to farming, being closely
associated with the agricultural interests of Stearns county, where he owned a
valuable farm property. At length, however, he divided his land among his
children and is now living retired in the enjoyment of a rest which he has
truly earned and richly deserves. His wife died in 1911. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>The
family of Mr. and Mrs. Nicholas Mohs numbered eleven children, of whom nine are
yet living: Frank; Valentine, a resident farmer of Stearns county, Minnesota;
Mathias, who also follows farming in that county; Peter, a resident farmer of
the same county; Michael, who is manager for a lumber company at Eden, South
Dakota; Anna, also living in Eden: George, a farmer of Stearns county: Mary,
the wife of Nick Garding, who cultivates a farm in Stearns county; and N. L., manager
of a book and music store at St. Cloud, Minnesota. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>Frank
Mohs was educated in the public schools of his native county and in St. John's
College at Collegeville, Minnesota, from which institution he was graduated,
completing a commercial course in 1890. He then entered upon a business career
as bookkeeper in the Bank of Melrose at Melrose, Minnesota, where he remained
for three years. In 1893 he and a young companion managed to secure a capital
of one hundred dollars and embarked in the drug business at Melrose but after
conducting a store there for two years Mr. Mohs sold out. He then engaged in
the furniture and undertaking business with H. J. Haskamp, of Melrose, with
whom he was connected for five years, at the end of which time he purchased Mr.
Haskamp's interest and remained alone in the business. On the 27th of July
1903, he arrived in Webster, where he purchased the furniture and undertaking
establishment of Benjamin &amp; Foster and in November of the same year he
bought the store of Albert Forsen. He has since conducted the business under
his own name and enjoys an extensive trade as a furniture dealer, carrying a
large stock and putting forth every effort to meet the wants of his patrons. In
1896 he aided in organizing the undertakers of Minnesota, which was the first
year in which undertakers were required to pass an examination, his number
being 24. He believes that there should be strict requirements for those who
engage in that line of business, hence his efforts in that direction. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>On
the 18th of September 1894, Mr. Mohs was united in marriage to Miss Mary A.
Grundman, a daughter of Ernest H. Grundman, who was born in Holland about 1830
and came to the United States with his sister when eleven years of age. He was
a millwright in the Washburn-Crosby mills of Minneapolis and was killed in the
big mill explosion there. Mr. and Mrs. Mohs have become the parents of five
children: Cecilia, who was graduated from the Webster high school on the 29th
of May 1915; and Gertrude, Bernadine, Frank and Irene, all yet in school. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>The
families are communicants of the Catholic Church and Mr. Mohs is at the head of
the Catholic Order of Foresters in South Dakota, having been elected for a
second time in June, 1915. His political allegiance is given to the Democratic
Party. He was an active factor in political circles in Minnesota and held all
of the city offices there. In April, 1911, he was elected mayor of Webster and
has twice been reelected, receiving the entire vote of the people without
opposition. What higher testimony of public confidence could be given than this
or what better proof that his administration has been progressive and
beneficial. Mr. Mohs is truly a self-made man and deserves much credit for what
he has accomplished. He has always applied himself earnestly to the conduct of
his business and prosperity has attended his efforts. He now not only owns a
large stock of furniture and undertakers' supplies but also owns the building
in which he conducts his business and has one of the large stores of this part
of the state. The same thoroughness and system, which characterize the
management of his individual affairs, is manifest in his conduct of municipal
interests. He avoids public extravagance and needless retrenchment and has
followed the sane, even path that leads to steady progress and improvement. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
