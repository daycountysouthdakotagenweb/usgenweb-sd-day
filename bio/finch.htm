<p class=MsoNormal>NELSON LEE FINCH, president of the Citizens' State Bank of
Andover, Andover, Day County, is a native of the Empire state of the Union,
having been born in Broadalbin, Fulton county, New York, on the 12th of
January, 1873, a son of William W. and Carrie (Lee) Finch, both of whom were
likewise born in the state of New York, being of English and English-French
lineage respectively. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The subject of this sketch attended the public schools of
his native town until he had attained the age of ten years, when, in 1883, he
accompanied his parents on their removal to South Dakota, the family locating
in Andover, Day county, where the father engaged in the mercantile business.
Here Nelson continued to attend the public schools until 1889, during which
year and that following he was a student in the South Dakota State Agricultural
College, at Brookings, as a member of the class of 1893. In 1890 he continued
his educational discipline in the Curtiss Commercial College, in Minneapolis,
Minnesota, being graduated in July of that year. He then returned to his home
in Andover and was thereafter associated with his father in the management of
his business affairs until 1895. In January of that year his parents removed to
New York state, our subject purchasing at that time his father's general
merchandise business in Andover. This enterprise he successfully conducted
until June, 1897, when he sold the same to E. C. Toy and soon afterward
effected the organization of the Citizens' Bank, of which he continued
proprietor and manager until July, 1902, when the institution was reorganized
and incorporated as the Citizens' State Bank, and Mr. Finch has been its
president from its inception, while Wallace Finch, of Gloversville, New York,
is vice-president, and J. W. Krueger, cashier. The bank has a capital and
surplus of twenty-five thousand dollars and is one of the solid and
well-managed financial concerns of the state. The bank building is a
substantial and attractive brick structure and the counting rooms are modern in
their equipments and facilities, a portion of the building being utilized for
the offices of the Day County Land Company. Of this latter corporation Mr.
Finch was one of the organizers, in 1898, and when it was incorporated, in
1902, he was elected secretary and treasurer, which dual office he held until
November 1, 1903. In December of the same year Mr. Finch disposed of his stock
and retired from the institution. Mr. Finch was the first president of the
Andover Hotel Company, owners of the magnificent Hotel Waldorf, recently
erected in Andover, and for several years was a director and executive officer
in two other corporations there. He is president of the board of education, and
has ever taken a deep and helpful interest in educational affairs and in all
else that makes for the well-being of his home town, county and state. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Mr. Finch is a member of the Baptist church, and fraternally
is a Knight Templar, a thirty-second-degree Mason and a Noble of the Mystic
Shrine. In politics he is a stanch Republican, and while he has taken an active
part in the promotion of the party cause he has never sought or held official
preferment, except that of city treasurer, of which he has been continuously
incumbent since 1897.. He enjoys the highest popularity in business and social
circles and is one of the progressive and able young businessmen of South
Dakota. Mr. Finch is a bachelor. </p>
