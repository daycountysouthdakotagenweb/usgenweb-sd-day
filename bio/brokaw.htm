<p class=MsoNormal>RICHARD P. BROKAW is the oldest settler in Bristol and one
of Day County's leading citizens. Mr. Brokaw was born July 3, 1843, in Seneca
county, New York. His parents, Joseph and Sarah (Patterson) Brokaw, were both
natives of New York. His father was a butcher by trade and died in his native
state. Richard was educated in the district schools of the Empire State and
afterwards became a butcher. In July 1862, he enlisted at Geneva, New York, in
Company E, One Hundred and Forty-eighth New York Infantry, and went to the war.
He served three years in the commissary department and issued rations during
that time to from six to eight thousand men. He was connected with the Army of
the James during the entire time of his enlistment. At the close of the war he
went to Illinois and resumed work as a butcher, going into business at Joliet.
A short time after he went to Michigan and took up fruit farming, which he
continued for four years. He then went to South Dakota and settled upon a farm
between Elk point and Vermillion. He spent eight years there and subsequently
worked upon a nearby railroad for two years. In the spring of 1881 he removed
to Day county and on June 6th of that year became a resident of Bristol. He
helped to lay out the embryo town, bought the first lot, and the following
spring put up the first house ever built there. Since that time he has been
engaged in the hotel business at Bristol, and is one of the most genial,
popular and widely known bonifaces in the northwestern part of the state
Politically Mr. Brokaw is a Republican, but has never sought nor held office of
any kind. </p>
