<p class=MsoNormal>REV. J. H. DOLNY, pastor of St. Peter's church at Platte and
of St. Mark's at Lake Andes, was born November 3, 1883, in Prussian Poland, a
son of John and Julianna Dolny. His father, who was a farmer by occupation, has
passed to his reward. Rev. J. H. Dolny received the greater part of his
education in Germany and there pursued his classical and philosophical courses </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He completed his study in theology in St. Paul Seminary at
St. Paul, Minnesota, and was there ordained to the priesthood in 1910 by Bishop
Hefferon for the diocese of Sioux Falls. He said his first mass at Grenville,
South Dakota. He was stationed at the mission at Leola for a year and was later
at Miller for six months. Subsequently he was pastor of the church at Waubay
for a year and in 1914 he was given charge of St. Peter's church at Platte and
of St. Mark's at Lake Andes with residence at Platte. There are forty-five
families in each congregation and the two churches are strong forces in the
moral and spiritual life of their respective communities. Rev. Dolny gives his
attention and thought to building up his two churches and to fostering the
growth of strong Christian character in his parishioners, but he does not
forget that the church has a mission to the world at large and seeks to aid in
embodying Christian teachings in the community life. He is energetic and
progressive as well as zealous and cooperates in all movements seeking the
moral development of his county and state. He has gained the confidence and
esteem of those who have come in contact with him irrespective of their
religious belief. </p>
