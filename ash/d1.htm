 Obituary of Daniel E. Ash
<BR>
    Daniel E. Ash, father of H. E. Ash, of this place, died at Elk City, Oklahoma,
January 10, 1908. Deceased was aged 89 years, 4 months, and 10 days. He was kiving
with his son, James, in Elk City, where they had moved from Rankin about two
months ago. Mr. Ash led an interesting career, having been chosen captain of
Company E 99th Indiana Volunteers in 1863 and serving one year toward the close
of the Civil War. He leaves besides his two sons one daughter, Mrs. Kate Clark,
of Eureka, California. The relatives have our sympathy in the loss of this respected
and beloved member of their family.

Ash
<BR>

<BR>
     Daniel Ash, one of the very early settlers of this town and county, died
at the home of his son James, in Elk City, Oklahoma, where he has resided for
a number of years. His age was 88 years last August, and his death was caused
from a general breaking down of old age, after a sickness lasting several years.
<BR>
     He leaves two sons, one in Oklahoma, one in Dakota, one daughter in California,
one brother in Idaho and one sister , Mrs. C. C. Deardurff in Morocco.
<BR>
     Mr. Ash lived in Morocco many years and was well known by all our older
settlers. In fact he was one of the builders of the town, and is responsible
as few others (paper torn at this point) time that the town was creating its
fine prosperity.
