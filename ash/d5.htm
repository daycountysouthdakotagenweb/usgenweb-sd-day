1938 in Big Arm , Montana.                                       Pioneer Woman
Of Butler Is Buried
<BR>
     Closing the last chapter of a life wherein was written a chronicle of service
to her community and her friends, Lorinda M. Ash, one of Butler's most respected
citizens, peacefully crossed the last frontier on Sunday afternoon at Big Arm,
Montana, where she has spent the past winter, in company with her two daughters,
Elsie and Hattie, and her two sons Charles and Ivan.
<BR>
     Lorinda M. Archibald was born in Morocco, Newton County, Indiana, March
8, 1849; and was at the time of her passing, 89 years, one month, and 16 days
of age.
<BR>
     At the early age of ten years, she lost both her parents. An uncle, a Christian
minister, took her to raise and it was at this time that she united with the
Christian church. Her early education and girlhood was spent at Morocco and it
was here that she taught school for two years.
<BR>
     On March 15, 1865, she was united in marriage to Henry E. Ash of Morocco,
Indiana, and to them were born eleven children. Two daughters, Joy and Candace,
and her husband preceded her in death. She is survived by four daughters: Elsie
of Butler; Eva (Mrs. O. P. Olson) of Lily; Maud (Mrs. J.L. Dahl) of Polson, Montana;
and five sons: Dr. James Ash of Lake Andes; Ransom and Charles of Butler, Arles
of Rupert, Idaho, and Ivan of Polson, Montana, who mourn the loss of a kind and
loving mother.
<BR>
     Shortly after their marriage, the young couple started housekeeping on a
farm in Indiana, and resided there until 1876, when they moved by emigrant wagon
to Douglas County, Minnesota. In 1882 they moved to Day Co. which has been her
continuous residence except two years in southern Georgia, and the past three
winters in Polson and Big Arm, Montana.
<BR>
     Mrs. Ash was among those sturdy pioneers who struggled with the hardships
and trials of the early settlers and lived to see the results of years of labor
in the fine farm which has been her home. She was an uncomplaining wife and mother.
Life she faced with a smile and was never known to speak ill of anyone.
<BR>
     &quot;Auntie Ash&quot; as she was familiarly known, will be missed in the
Butler community where she spent the greater share of her life. Although she
has not been in the best of health for the past twenty years, her upright character
and cheerful, winning personality won for her many friends. Her's was a life
well spent, filled with many acts of love and usefulness to those around her.
<BR>
     The body reached Butler Tuesday and was taken to the home of her son Ransom,
where a stream of friends came to speak words of sympathy to the sorrowing family.
<BR>
     Funeral services were held (Wednesday) afternoon, at 2 o'clock at the Evangelical
church, Rev. Bergland officiating. Numerous bouquets and sprays of flowers were
a beautiful silent testimony of the esteem in which the deceased was held.
<BR>
     Interment was made in Prairie Mound Cemetery, beside the graves of her husband
and daughter Joy.
<BR>
     Pall bearers were: G. P. Essington, Albert Zimmerman, John Roseth, Frank
Herr, Rex Batie, and W. C. Wingard.
<BR>
     Out of town relatives who came to attend the funeral were: Dr. James Ash
and wife of Lake Andes, Arles Ash of Rupert, Idaho, Robert Ash of Minneapolis,
Minn., Frances Ash of Clear Lake, Floyd Yeager of Sioux Falls, Mr. and Mrs. Guy
McKibben of Webster and Mr. and Mrs. O. P. Olson and son Kenneth of Lily.  Henry
Enos ASH and Laurinda Maria ARCHIBALD had the following children:

                                             ( Butler Correspondent)
<BR>
     Many hearts in this community were saddened last Tuesday morning when it
became known that Miss Elsie Gay Ash had passed away at eight o'clock the previous
 morning, in San Diego, California, where she had submitted to an operation 
on Friday, March 17th.
<BR>
     Miss Ash had not been in  in good health for about two years, but she accompanied
her brothers, Charles and Ivan and her sister, Mrs. Hattie McCloskey, leaving
on November 4, for California, hoping the change of climate might prove beneficial.
Dr. B. A. Adams of San Diego, California, formerly of Bristol, an old friend
and family physician for many years and was her attending physician during her
illness and all that medical science and loving hands could do was not enough.
<BR>
     Elsie Gay Ash, 61, daughter of the late Henry and Lorinda M. Ash, well known
pioneer couple of this community, was born August 14, 1882, and passed away at
the Mercy Hospital at San Diego, California, March 27, 1944. Her entire life
was spent near the place of her birth, and to Miss Ash goes the honor of being
the first child  born in Butler Township, on the homestead of her parents one
mile west of Butler. She attended grade school, followed by one year spent at
the Aberdeen Normal, after which she spent seven years as a teacher in this community,
having taught in the  Butler town school for four years. For a number of years
she was employed in the Olson Mercantile store at Lily. As a child she attended
the Methodist church and for years was a member of the Royal Neighbor Lodge.
<BR>
     Gifted from the first with a broad and deep sense of human sympathy, &quot;Elsie&quot;
entered fully into the life around her. For fifteen years she and her brother
Charles were constant companions of their mother, caring for her in her declining
years. Her life has been full of service, not only to her own  family, but also
to others. With a smile for everyone, she plucked victory out of defeat. She
invested wisely and well every talent given her and her memory will be ever a
blessed one, to all whose privelege it was to know her. She personified these
lines of Ella Wheeler Wilcox: &quot; It is easy enough to be pleasant when life
flows by like a song; but the man worth while is the one who will smile when
everything goes wrong. For the test of the heart is trouble, and it always comes
with the years; and the smile that is worth the praises of earth, is the smile
that shines through the tears.&quot;
<BR>
     Funeral services were held Monday afternoon at 2 'clock from the Evangelical
church at Butler with Rev. C. M. Bergland, pastor, officiating, at the last sad
rites. Masses of beautiful flowers, parting tributes from her many friends who
had known and loved her filled the air with their fragrance. Musical selections
were sung by the male quartet composed of Marvin Luckow, Olaf Bye, Sam Knebel,
and Ben Bohn, accopanied by Mrs. Ed Buhler. The hymns were &quot; We're Going
Down the Valley&quot; , &quot;The Beautiful Land&quot;, &quot;Shall You, Shall
I&quot;. Pall bearers were old friends and neighbors of the deceased, Otto and
Albert Zimmerman, Jorn Roseth, G. P. Essington, M. C. Wingard and Reuben Ihrke.
Burial was in the family lot at Prairie Mound Cemetery .
<BR>
     She was preceede in death by her parents, 3 sisters, Candace,Joy, and Eva
and one brother, James.
<BR>
     Left to mourn her passing are four bothers, Charles, Ransom, Ivan of Butler
and Arles of Rupert, Idaho; Mrs. J. L. Dahl (Maud) of Riverside, California,
and Mrs. Hattie McCloskey, beside many relatives and friends.
