        More Wedding Bells
<BR>
     W. A. Hart of Rolla, North Dakota, was in Minneapolis last week, and so
was Miss Candace Lenoi Ash of this place.  Miss Maud Ash too is in Minneapolis
and Mr. and Mrs. McCloskey of Garden City were there.
<BR>
     Out of these facts were shaped an item of news that was a great surprise
to Butler and vicinity. Mr. Hart and Miss Ash were united in marriage on Monday,
July 23, and announced that they will be at home in Rolla, North Dakota after
September 15th. They are now spending their honeymoon in Duluthll, Minnesota.
<BR>
     Mr. Hart is an old resident of Butler and Miss Ash has spent most of her
life there. Both are well liked and have the best wishes ofj a host of friends.
We will try to forgive them for going off without a word of warning. We like
to be economical but it is  a pleasure to be lavish with rice and charivari music.

                                               A Daughter At Hart's
<BR>
     A tiny maiden came on Thursday, February 18, to cheer the home and brighten
the lives of Mr. and Mrs. W.A. Hart, of this city. The mother is getting along
nicely and Mr. Hart is perfectly able-and willing- to buy and present to his
friends the best cigars in town-in fact he seems highly pleased about it. The
little girl's name is Genevieve Laurinda Hart-which will doubtless be sufficient
for her needs for twenty years or thereabouts.
