Obituary of Evelyn Daniel
<BR>
     Evelyn Peckham Daniel, Co-publisher of the Sonora Daily, died Friday in
Stanford University Hospital in Palo Alto. She was 78.
<BR>
     Mrs. Daniel, a native of Lily, S. D., was co- founder of the newspaper with
her husband, O.K. Peckham. She helped run the paper from its founding in October,
1938, until its sale in July, 1958, when it was incorporated into the Union Democrat.
<BR>
     She functioned in all capacities at the Daily during its20 years of puplishing,
from answering phones and taking classified ads to layout, pasteup and organizing
the delivery boys.
<BR>
     She saw the paper grow from a letter-size mimeographed sheet filled with
advertising to a full-fledged, photo-offset newspaper.
<BR>
     The offset printing method, which up to 1950 hadn't been used by the competing,
letterpress weeklies in the country, led to a landmark legal decision.
<BR>
     When the competition, led by The Union Democrat, attempted to block legal
adjudication, the case went all the way to the California Supreme Court. The
Sonora Daily was victorious. The decision paved the way for newspapers throughout
the state.
<BR>
     A plaque noting the history of the Sonora Daily was dedicated in 1983 at
the original site of the office on North Washington Street.
<BR>
     After the paper was sold, Mrs. Daniel continued to be active in the community.
<BR>
She volunteered her time and business knowledge for numerous organizations. She
was often seen in downtown Sonora, selling tickets to drawings for any number
of causes.
<BR>
     One of her efforts was a fund-raising crusade for the American Cancer Society.
She worked for a number of years in the 1970's soliciting contributions from
area businesses.
<BR>
     Mrs. Daniel was named Emblem Club member of the year in 1973 for her contributions
to that organization.
<BR>
     She also belonged to the Sonora Soroptimist Club and Church Women United
of St. Matthews 's Lutheran Church.
<BR>
     She volunteered her time for Sonora Community Hospital, the Tuolumne Co.
Humane Society and the American Red Cross.
<BR>
     Mrs. Daniel is survived by her husband, Charles Daniel of Sonora; two sons,
Elwyn Peckham of San Francisco and Charles Peckham of Covallis, Oregon; two daughters,
Donna Dawson of Chico and Betty Mitchell of Palo Alto; two brothers, Kenneth
Olson of Corvallis and Pershing Olson of Turlock; a sister, Jean Barry of Berkeley,
16 grandchildren and six great grandchildren.
<BR>
     Services will be held Wednesday at 11 a.m. at the Terzich-Wilson Funeral
Home with the Rev. Wallace Brookfield of St. Matthew's Lutheran Church officiating.
Burial will follow in Mountain Shadow Cemetery.
<BR>
     The Family requests that memorials be made to the American Cancer Society
or the donor's favorite charity.<P><A NAME="P6200"></A><B>Charles Wesley DANIEL</B>
